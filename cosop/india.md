Executive summary

4.

The results-based country strategic opportunities programme (RB-COSOP) has
evolved through a two-year-long engagement with the Government of India and
other stakeholders. It reflects the ambitious development agenda set by the
Government and the rising aspirations of a rural community in a state of rapid
transition. The COSOP design takes into consideration the learning and
recommendations of the 2016 country programme evaluation (CPE),1 building on
programme successes while seeking to exploit opportunities for impact at scale.

The overarching goal for the IFAD country programme in India from 2018 to 2024
is to maximize IFAD’s contribution to the Government strategy for doubling
farmers’ income by 2022. To this end, the country programme has a single, focused
strategic objective (SO): Smallholder food and agricultural production
systems are remunerative, sustainable and resilient. All IFAD
activities – lending and non-lending – will contribute to its achievement.

Investment projects that respond to this agenda will be simpler, larger and
shorter in duration, and will reflect one or all three key elements of the
strategic objective. Unbundling these in programmatic terms would
mean: (i) supporting better price realization, agro-based enterprises and the
promotion of value chains with the multiplier effect of reducing migration and
making agriculture attractive for youth; (ii) tried and tested techniques such as low
external input sustainable agriculture and precision farming practices that
contribute towards sustainable agriculture intensification; and (iii) diversification of
crops and livelihoods, promotion of integrated farming and improving the outreach
of social security nets to build resilience to climate change and market variability.
Projects will continue to target disadvantaged areas with predominantly rainfed
agriculture that are vulnerable to climate change – particularly the north-east
region and eastern states. With its focus on poor and marginal smallholder farmers
and the landless, the programme will specifically target scheduled tribes, scheduled
castes and other groups that are vulnerable to poverty and malnutrition.
Recognizing that women and youth not only engage in agriculture in large numbers,
but are also key to rural transformation, there will be a strong focus on women’s
empowerment and the engagement of youth as change agents, innovators and
entrepreneurs.

The scaling-up plan will be inbuilt into project designs and pursued through strong
evidence generation and innovative partnerships with government, the private
sector and other stakeholders. South-South and Triangular Cooperation (SSTC) will
be pursued to expand the outreach of India's agricultural expertise, while also
enhancing the performance of the country’s agricultural sector. Partnerships with
government, knowledge centres, the private sector, civil society and development
partners – including the other Rome-based agencies (RBAs) – will contribute to the
agenda.

5.

The COSOP will cover two cycles of the performance-based allocation system
(PBAS): 2019-2021 and 2022-2024. Based on IFAD’s PBAS formula, the allocation
for 2019-2021 is US$166,250,000.2

1 The main recommendations of the CPE (2016) are summarized in the agreement at completion point in Appendix II.
2 The PBAS figure is the indicative allocation for the Republic of India, estimated at US$166,250,000. The final allocation
will be presented to the 125th session of the Executive Board for endorsement by the forty-second session of the
Governing Council in 2019.

INDIA

Country strategic opportunities programme

I. Country diagnosis
A. Socio-economic context
1.

Overview. India is the world’s seventh-largest country by land area, with a vast
range of ecosystems3 that offer a spectrum of livelihood challenges and
opportunities. With 1.31 billion inhabitants and a population growth rate of
approximately 1.2 per cent per year, India is also poised to become the world’s
most populous country by around 2028. While the country’s urban population grows
at a much faster rate than the rural population,4 two out of every three people in
India live in rural areas. However, the rural population is expected to peak around
2030 and then decline.

2.

3.

4.

5.

The economy. India is now classified as a lower-middle-income country, with
GDP per capita estimated at US$1,710 (2016) and with a Human Development
Index of 0.624 (2015). India ranks as the third-largest global economic power at
purchasing power parity. The economy – growing at over 7 per cent per annum – is
projected to be the fastest-growing of all G20 economies. With structural
transformation well under way, India’s service sector is the fastest-growing part of
the economy, contributing 54 per cent GDP in 2016. Industry contributes
29 per cent and agriculture contributes 17 per cent respectively. The long-term
prospects for growth are positive, due to India’s young population, corresponding
low dependency ratio, healthy savings and investment rates, and increasing
integration into the global economy.

Poverty. Although India still has the highest number of poor people in the world,
extreme poverty has been substantially reduced. In 2011/2012, the overall poverty
rate was estimated at 22 per cent, although this figure hides a considerable
rural-urban gap (26 per cent versus 14 per cent). Some 80 per cent of the
270 million poor people live in the rural areas. Households from scheduled tribes
and scheduled castes experienced upward mobility, but poverty among these
groups in rural areas is higher than the average (United Nations Sustainable
Development Framework, 2018). Inclusive growth is therefore a priority for India,
including inclusive agricultural transformation.

Nutrition. India grows sufficient food and has the world’s largest public distribution
system for food delivery and a wide-ranging network of state-level mechanisms to
reach every citizen. However, this has not translated into comparable declines in
the levels of malnutrition, which remains a major issue:
36 per cent of children under five are underweight; 38 per cent are stunted; and
21 per cent are wasted. Micronutrient deficiencies are also extremely high. The
poorest, the scheduled tribes and castes, and those in rural areas, suffer the
greatest malnourishment.

Gender issues. India ranks number 125 of 160 countries on the gender inequality
index (GII=0.530 in 2015) and in order to bridge the gender gap, the Government
is giving priority to women’s social and economic empowerment. This is reflected in
the strong support to livelihood improvement programmes and promotion of self-
help groups, which have created opportunities for women to access finance,
extension services for crops and livestock husbandry, and drudgery-reducing
equipment, thus improving household incomes and women’s decision-making

3 The ecosystems comprise mountainous upland areas in the north, the low-lying Indo-Gangetic Plains, sub-humid coastal
zones and the semi-arid Deccan Plateau on the southern end of the peninsula.
4 At 2.2% and 0.2% respectively (during the 2014/2015 period), in 2015 the country remains predominantly rural.

power. Recognizing that in rural areas 75 per cent of female workers are engaged
in agriculture, and that they have comparatively more limited access to productive
resources, the Government has developed a gender mainstreaming strategy for its
agricultural programmes (Volume XI of the Report of the Committee on
Doubling Farmers' Income [DFI], 2017).

B. The agricultural sector and rural economy
6.

India’s agricultural sector grew on average between 2 per cent to slightly less than
5 per cent annually between 2011 and 2017. As expected, the agricultural share
within total output is declining. It nevertheless remains a key source of employment
for almost half of India’s working population. Growth in the sector has both
stimulated rapid growth of the rural non-farm economy and in addition has been a
major driver of rural poverty reduction.

7.

8.

9.

Over the past 50 years India has gone from dependency on food aid to becoming a
consistent net exporter of food. Food grains and oilseeds still account for almost
80 per cent of the area under cultivation, although India has diversified into
high-value commodities and has become the world’s largest producer of milk,
pulses, horticultural products and livestock, and the top exporter of shrimp and
spices globally. Although most crop yields have at least tripled, they are still
relatively low by regional standards. Despite an increased area under irrigation,5
55 per cent of India’s total area under cultivation and 40 per cent of all crop
production are still rainfed and thus more vulnerable to monsoon variability.

Farm sizes are typically small: the average size has fallen from 2.28 ha in
1970/1971 to 1.15 ha in 2011/2012, with 85 per cent of holdings now under 2 ha.
Smaller and marginal farms are also associated not only with lower agricultural
incomes, but also with lower shares of total household income derived from
agriculture. While farm sizes continue to fall, India’s rural labour force is still
increasing. However, growing mechanization – combined with increasing rural wage
rates – have resulted in a real decline in employment in agriculture (by 37 million
people between 2005 and 2012).

Climate change. Indian agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change, largely
because the sector continues to be very sensitive to monsoon variability. Seasonal
water scarcity, rising temperatures and more frequent risk of drought jeopardize
the country’s food security. Should these trends persist, rice and wheat yields are
projected to decline substantially. By the 2050s, the country may need to import
more than twice the amount of food grains than it would require without climate
change. Climate change will affect in particular the most vulnerable groups –
farmers in rainfed areas, landless labourers and women, whose incomes are likely
to decline by 20 to 25 per cent (Economic Survey, 2017/2018). Hence a major
challenge for India is to promote the widespread adoption of climate-smart
techniques and other adaptation measures that sustain production and productivity,
and ensure continued national food and nutritional security.

10. Poverty and agriculture. Smaller farmers in rainfed areas are most prone to

living in poverty, as they generate smaller marketable surpluses and face greater
challenges in accessing markets. They are more vulnerable to climate risks, and are
uncompetitive entrants in expanding credit and input markets. Water table
depletion and soil erosion – as well as the unbalanced use of subsidized fertilizer
that has in the long run harmed soil fertility – have emerged as pressing issues in
many areas. They highlight the need for sustainable intensification of rainfed
agricultural production, and improved management of soil and water resources.

11. Agriculture and the larger rural economy. Overall, the proportion of households

whose principal source of income depends on agriculture had declined to
58 per cent by 2012/2013. Farmers are diversifying into more remunerative

5 Today India has the largest area of agricultural land under irrigation of any country in the world.

self-employment in the non-farm sector and are becoming part-time farmers. The
largest sources of non-farm employment are the construction sector, transport and
services. Of the activities that make up these three categories, probably on the
order of one third is related to agricultural value chains.

C. Policy and institutional context

12. Since agriculture falls under state-level jurisdiction, state governments are those

primarily responsible for the growth and development of the sector. The central
Government supplements these efforts through policy and budgetary support, and
specific schemes. In addition, the NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming
India) – as the country’s principal policymaking body – brings out occasional policy
papers/road maps to guide agricultural reforms. The private sector and civil society
are increasingly engaged in all aspects of agriculture. The private sector is
increasingly investing in service delivery to end consumers at an affordable price.

13.

India’s agricultural policy reflects the Government’s priority focus on
farmers’ welfare and sustainable agriculture. Accordingly, in 2015 the central
Government renamed the Ministry of Agriculture as the Ministry of Agriculture
and Farmers’ Welfare, and shifted its focus from enhanced productivity, to doubling
farmers’ income in real terms by 2022.

14. The central Government proposed a number of policy reforms such as land tenancy
reform and market reforms and these are at various stages of adoption in the
states. Recently, the central Government expanded the minimum support price to a
large range of agricultural produce so as to enable farmers to better cope with price
volatility. To reverse the trend of deterioration of land and water resources, the
Government introduced the soil health card, shifted the fertilizer subsidy to
producers through a direct benefit transfer, embarked on neem coating of urea
fertilizers, provided impetus to the Organic Mission and subsidized micro-irrigation
equipment powered by solar energy. Through its programmes focusing on climate
resilient agriculture, appropriate adaptation strategies were developed for ensuring
food security and livelihoods6. In addition, India ratified the Paris Agreement in
2016 and formulated its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is on track to achieve the target for the use
of renewable energy in power generation and to overachieve the emissions
intensity target submitted under the
Paris Agreement.

15.

India has one of the largest and well coordinated agricultural research systems in
the world, which has made a significant contribution in transforming the country
into an agricultural powerhouse. The research system is primarily driven by the
public sector and is structured around the Indian Council of Agricultural Research,
its agencies at federal level and agricultural universities at state level. With greater
focus given to farmers’ incomes and welfare, the research system needs to adapt
research and development to address new emerging challenges related to climate
change, market volatility, soil erosion and water depletion.

16.

Public expenditure on agriculture comes from the state governments and the
central Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. The central Government’s
agriculture budget increased by 45 per cent (in nominal terms) over the last
three years. The total share for agriculture in the 2018/2019 budget reached
10 per cent, reflecting the priority accorded to the sector.

6 Despite climate variability, India could produce record food grain output of 270 million tons and 300 million tons of
horticulture produce.

national policies or introduction
of new national schemes
overlapping with project
activities
Project management and
performance: Limited staff
capacity and high turnover of
project directors

Implementation:

funds, contributing to low
disbursement rates
Scaling up: IFAD unable to
leverage its project experience

Conflict: Local conflict in some
programme areas, undermining
operations or leading to
implementation delays
Climate: Climate
shocks/increased frequency of
drought make rainfed
smallholder agriculture unviable

II. Lessons learned8
18. Long engagement in India. IFAD has been working in India for more than

30 years. IFAD’s programme – its largest in the world – comprises 29 investment
projects valued at US$2,900,000,000 and benefiting an estimated 4.78 million
households. IFAD-financed projects have targeted the poorest and most vulnerable
groups, including marginal farmers, women, youth, the landless, tribal communities
and scheduled castes. Projects have consistently tackled structural issues such as
socio-cultural exclusion and a lack of access to natural resources, agricultural land
and quality public services.

19. Evaluation results. The Independent Office of Evaluation’s 2016 CPE and the
2011-2017 COSOP completion review found that most projects achieved their
objectives. Within the portfolio, progress on gender equity was seen as particularly
strong. Overall portfolio impact was assessed as satisfactory in terms of household
assets and income and of human and social capital. The CPE recommended: (a)
using a more contextualized approach to community organization; (b) focusing
more prominently on rainfed agriculture; (c) improving the efficiency of portfolio

7 Please refer to IFAD Guidelines for Disaster Early Recovery, 2011 and in particular sections VII and VIII of the report.
8 Detailed lessons learned are available in the 2011-2017 RB-COSOP completion review, which is one of the background
documents for this COSOP.

implementation; (d) promoting scaling up of results by strengthening partnerships;
and (e) enhancing capacity and resources for non-lending activities. All of these are
reflected in the current COSOP.

20. Programme successes. The completion review for the COSOP 2010-2017

confirms that IFAD-supported projects have had several important successes. In
supporting smallholder farmers, projects have brokered partnerships between
government and civil society organizations for last mile delivery of public services to
remote and marginalized groups. In doing so, they have ensured convergence with
government development schemes. They have also: promoted community
ownership of those services; supported a range of technologies and practices to
enhance productivity, sustainability and resilience; promoted the diversification of
agricultural enterprises; and supported aggregation of demand (for inputs) and
supply (of produce). All these experiences offer valuable building blocks for future
investments.

21. However, opportunities are not fully exploited. While the programme has

achieved real successes, rigorous evidence is lacking for these successes and their
underlying factors. IFAD has not sufficiently shared the innovations of its projects
with key sectoral ministries in the central Government; nor has it helped draw out
key lessons or scaled-up successes. This has led to missed opportunities to
influence national policies. Under the new COSOP, IFAD will: pay greater attention
to knowledge management; stay focused on key sectoral ministries; and engage
with state and central governments on key policy issues drawn from project results
with direct benefit to poor and marginalized rural people.

III.Strategic objective and comparative advantage
22.

IFAD is a well-respected development partner for the Government of India.
Nevertheless, in recent years India has changed rapidly: at the macroeconomic
level; in its agricultural and rural economy; in the economic aspirations of its rural
people – particularly women and youth; and in its government’s policy and strategic
priorities. In order to stay relevant, IFAD must offer services that recognize and
respond to this dynamic, capitalizing on its specific mandate and organizational
strengths.

23.

24.

IFAD’s financial offer to India is tiny relative to the national budget for agriculture.
As an emerging middle-income country, India’s interest is in achieving its ambitious
policy goal of doubling farmers’ incomes while drawing on support from IFAD’s
innovations, experience and knowledge. To respond to this agenda, IFAD will
strengthen the focus on climate-resilient agriculture and value chain development
(with an understanding of agriculture as encompassing crop and livestock
production, fisheries and forestry activities).

IFAD’s comparative advantage will thus be in supporting government efforts by
innovating to develop smarter solutions for doubling the incomes of poor and
marginalized farming communities that are dependent on rainfed production
systems and vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The projects that respond
to this agenda will be simpler, larger and shorter in duration. The Government is
also emphasizing the importance of evidence-based results and independent
assessment of the innovative features of IFAD-supported projects to inform further
scaling up of tested solutions. Thus enhanced knowledge management – and
South-South and Triangular Cooperation – will be key dimensions of IFAD’s
approach.

25. The overarching goal for the IFAD country programme in India for 2018 to 2024 is

to maximize its contribution to the government strategy for doubling
farmers’ income. To achieve this goal, the country programme has a single, focused
SO to which all IFAD activities – lending and non-lending – will contribute.

SO1: Smallholder food and agricultural production systems are
remunerative, sustainable and resilient.

26. This SO focuses on economic empowerment of smallholder farmers through more
productive farm systems and more profitable participation in agricultural markets,
and through the generation of agro-related enterprises that create jobs and serve
smallholder farmers along agricultural value chains. The programme will develop
solutions along three key dimensions: remunerative, sustainable and resilient.

27. Remunerative. IFAD will address four key areas: (a) promoting technologies

aimed among other things at reducing production costs and drudgery, increasing
productivity, reducing post-harvest losses and adding value at farm/local level;
(b) supporting the development of pro-poor agricultural value chains, building
commercial relations between market intermediaries and smallholder producers,
supporting enterprises along value chains that provide services to smallholder
farmers, and helping organizations of farmers to participate on more favourable
terms in larger marketing platforms (e.g. e-National Agriculture Market);
(c) promoting diversification into high-value crops and farm enterprises; and
(d) enhancing access to markets and investing in market infrastructure, where
needed.

28. Sustainable. IFAD will promote sustainable intensification of agriculture and

diversified and integrated farming systems. Building on experience, efforts will
focus on two key areas: (a) participatory natural resource planning and
management, with a special focus on water demand management, combined with
geographical information system (GIS) technologies for land and water
development; and (b) tried and tested techniques such as low external input
sustainable agriculture and precision farming practices.

29. Resilient. Adaptation to climate change will continue to be a core consideration.

The programme will help smallholder farmers become more resilient by diversifying
their production systems and livelihoods, not only into high-value crops, but also
into other (agro-related) activities. The programme will also encourage high-value
and nutrition-dense commodities within farming systems. In addition, it will
promote access to financial services and government social protection schemes, to
broaden the reduction of smallholders’ vulnerability to shocks.

30.

31.

In promoting these three key dimensions, the IFAD programme will maintain and
build on the features that have contributed to the success of the past COSOP.
These include: paying close attention to poverty targeting and gender equality;
development of customized solutions for extension services and – more broadly –
for last-mile delivery of services; building sustainable membership-based
organizations; empowering marginalized rural people and building social capital;
ensuring linkage with the Panchayat Raj Institutions (system of governance in
which gram panchayats [village committees] are the basic units of local
administration), active convergence with a range of government schemes; and
helping in efficient community delivery.

Investment projects. At the start of the COSOP period in 2018, IFAD will have six
investment projects9 in their first to fourth year of implementation, with a total
implementation period ranging from six to eight years per project. Four of these are
aligned with the SO of the COSOP;10 the remaining two focus on tribal development
in areas where multiple deprivations call for continued integrated rural
development.11 Three of the six projects will close during the COSOP
period – including one of those that is less aligned.

9 There are currently nine on-going projects; however, three of these will be completing by March 2019 at latest. Their
results are reported against the previous COSOP.
10 The four projects are ILSP, LAMP, APDMP and FOCUS.
11 The two projects are JTELP and OPELIP.

32.

In addition, four new projects will be financed during the COSOP period, which is to
say two per PBAS cycle. The decision to restrict the number to two project designs
per cycle is aligned with the CPE 2010, which recommended “reducing the number
of loans but increasing their average size”. This enables more effective portfolio
management by IFAD and reduces the transaction and administrative burden on
the Government. The first of the four projects (appendix VII) is expected to be
presented to the IFAD Executive Board in 2019. The remaining projects will be
selected by the Government of India based on their alignment with national/state
priorities and the present COSOP.

33. Linkage to the SDGs. Through this COSOP, IFAD will contribute to achievement of

SDG1 (no poverty), SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG5 (gender equality), SDG8 (decent
work and economic growth), SDG10 (reduced inequalities) and SDG13 (climate
action). In addition, the country programme is aligned with the IFAD Strategic
Framework 2016-2025, in particular its SO 2 and SO 3, and with the United Nations
Sustainable Development Framework (UNSDF) for India (2018-22).

IV. Sustainable results
A. Targeting and gender
34.

IFAD defines targeting as purposefully designed actions and measures that ensure,
or at least significantly increase the likelihood, that specific groups of poor people –
women and men equally – will benefit from the development initiatives it supports,
while at the same time diminishing the risk that people who are less poor will
benefit disproportionately. IFAD defines its priority target group as the poorest rural
people with productive potential, and the organization measures its development
effectiveness against the needs of these people. IFAD works to support not only
people who are chronically poor, but also those at risk of becoming poor and
vulnerable to external shocks.12

35. Geographical targeting. In line with the CPE recommendation, the Government’s

interest in prioritizing lagging states and aspirational districts, and IFAD’s
comparative advantage in India, investment projects will continue to target
disadvantaged areas, in states with predominantly rainfed agriculture. The
north-east region and eastern states will be prioritized.

36. Target groups. With its focus on doubling farmers’ income, the programme will

target poor and marginal smallholders and the rural landless. Many of these will be
drawn from scheduled tribes, scheduled castes and other vulnerable groups. Target
groups will be identified using the Government’s extensive poverty database,
further refined at community level through use of participatory tools for wealth
ranking.

37. Gender. The programme will maintain its strong focus on gender13 and on the key
drivers of women’s empowerment. It will, among other things, support women as
agricultural producers, test labour-saving agricultural equipment, promote
entrepreneurial activities for women and negotiate women’s participation in project-
related decision-making bodies. It will in addition focus on improving nutrition
outcomes for rural households.

38. Youth. Young adults make up an expanding share of the population in India. While
rural youth have growing economic ambitions, they also have limited opportunities.
The programme will partner with youth as change agents and innovators, and
promote entrepreneurship for rural youth – both as agricultural producers and as

13 The results of the women’s empowerment index from two projects (Tejaswini Maharashtra and Mitigating Poverty in
Western Rajasthan) show women beneficiaries have higher levels of participation in decision-making regarding loan
utilization, production, income and access to resources and skills – and in family planning and the marriage of girl
children. Women beneficiaries are also more active in the social realm.

economic actors in the upstream and downstream segments of agro-based value
chains.

B. Scaling up
39. The CPE assessed the performance of the country programme on scaling up as

satisfactory; scaling up will continue to be an integral dimension of IFAD’s strategy
in India.

40.

IFAD’s approach to scaling up will work at two levels. First, IFAD will look to scale
up innovations through investment projects. Second, it will support further
scaling up of proven successes during project implementation, through rigorous
assessments and by pursuing the path of national programmes, larger development
projects and the private sector.

C. Policy engagement
41. Three broad, linked approaches can help the country programme contribute to the
Government’s policy agenda: (1) use projects to operationalize national policies at
the local level and test approaches; (2) identify policy blockages that constrain
project implementation and results, with possible solutions to these blockages; and
(3) share lessons that can be taken up through state- and national-level policies,
strategies and programmes, thus supporting the scaling-up agenda. Potential
sources of lessons and drivers of the policy agenda will include the project portfolio,
selected regional grants and global best practice that IFAD can help to broker. This
will focus on areas supporting achievement of the SO and capitalize on IFAD’s
demonstrated areas of strength.

42.

Policy-related activities will involve: analysis – the gathering of “policy evidence”
from the portfolio; dialogue, particularly among policymakers and other national
stakeholders; and dissemination and advocacy. Responsibility for the policy
engagement agenda will lie with the project management units, reputable policy
research institutions that will conduct analysis as necessary, and IFAD – which will
facilitate dialogue and disseminate lessons learned.

D. Natural resources and climate change
43.

IFAD will make natural resource management and climate change adaptation a core
feature of the programme14, through the sustainability and resilience dimensions of
the SO, as they are fundamental to increasing farmers’ income. It will invest in
promoting innovative, environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient
technologies and practices, covering crop varieties, soil health and water
conservation measures, integrated pest management, agroforestry and precision
farming. It will maintain those environmental services at watershed level that are
critical to ensuring reliable water supply and natural resource-based livelihoods and
agricultural production systems. It will invest in climate-proof infrastructure for
access to markets. The knowledge capacities of local communities and institutions
will also be enhanced through better access to information (including best
adaptation practices and climate data) and research products (cropping systems
and stress-resistant varieties). IFAD will also explore options for climate change
mitigation, including by reducing emissions from farming systems and accessing
carbon markets by selling sequestration services.

E. Nutrition-sensitive agriculture and rural development
44. While India has reduced malnutrition, levels stubbornly remain high. Food systems

represent one of the many dimensions of this situation. Supporting the
Government’s multi-sectoral approach, IFAD will focus on major drivers for
increasing and diversifying dietary intake, such as: assisting households to increase
their incomes and assets; promoting nutrition-sensitive agriculture; diversification
into nutrition-dense crops, livestock products and kitchen garden activities;

empowering women; and providing nutrition education. In pursuing this agenda,
IFAD will work with partners with relevant expertise, including the other
RBAs. In Odisha, where consultations are ongoing with the state government, the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Food
Programme, and the United Nations Children's Fund will develop a multidisciplinary
and integrated pilot intervention to end malnutrition in the tribal districts, thus
achieving SDG2.

V. Successful delivery
A. Financing framework
45.

In 2018, IFAD’s lending terms to India changed from blend to ordinary terms. For
the duration of the COSOP, ordinary terms will apply, given strong and stable
growth projections (The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
[OECD], 2018).

46. The indicative financial allocation for the 2019-2021 PBAS cycle is equivalent to
US$166,250,000. Table 1 illustrates how this allocation is derived. It is expected
that two projects would be funded in each PBAS cycle and US$1,000,000 to
US$2,000,000 per project will be set aside for in-loan grants for capacity-building
for the nodal and implementing agencies by well-reputed regional and international
agencies. The cofinancing ratio is envisaged at 1:1.4, in line with the Eleventh
Replenishment of IFAD's Resources (IFAD11) commitment.

47. Non-lending activities will be supported through regional grants, resources allocated

to the subregional hub for knowledge management, and potential supplementary
funds.

B. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
48.

IFAD16 and the Government of India will monitor progress in COSOP
implementation against its results management framework. Key outcomes and
milestone indicators are based on expected results from the project portfolio and
the related policy engagement. Project logical frameworks will be systematically
aligned with the COSOP results framework.

49. The M&E system of the country programme will be strengthened to provide reliable

data on programme outcomes and impacts, and a dashboard will be created to offer
real-time access to data on these and on key dimensions of project-level
performance. The IFAD Country Office will also develop partnership(s) with
reputable policy research institute(s) that can assist in standardizing the
methodology for annual project outcome surveys, in conducting targeted evaluation
studies that can provide the evidence necessary for effective policy engagement,
and in disseminating the findings. In addition, the ongoing monitoring and
evaluation certification project (CLEAR)17 is expected to boost M&E capacity in the
projects, while support from IFAD’s Research and Impact Assessment Division will
help institutionalize a robust impact assessment methodology.

50.

IFAD and DEA will review COSOP implementation and the results achieved on an
annual basis, as part of the Tripartite Portfolio Review Meetings (TPRM), and the
COSOP review reports will be disclosed. The mid-term COSOP Results Review will
take place in 2021, and the completion review in 2024. The annual review, as well
as the COSOP Results Review, will serve to realign COSOP implementation – as and
where needed – with the evolving national policies and priorities, as well as with the
lessons learned from ongoing projects.

C. Knowledge management
51. Knowledge management will be closely linked to the M&E function, and to the policy
engagement and scaling-up agendas. The programme’s knowledge agenda will seek
primarily to generate evidence from implementation to engage partners and
national stakeholders in dialogue on scaling up successful technologies, approaches
and processes. This sort of knowledge, generated from project level, will be built
both through systematic documentation of best practices and lessons learned, and
independent assessments to document the good practices and innovations.

52. At project level, IFAD will support and encourage knowledge management, both
through implementation and by bringing together the management units of
different projects to share experience and lessons learned and collectively resolve
implementation problems. At programme level, IFAD will seek opportunities to
engage more often on knowledge-sharing platforms beyond the current TPRM and
joint review of the IFAD-supported grant portfolio. As the country office in India is
transforming into the South Asia subregional hub,18 learning events will be
conducted on thematic issues and innovations derived from the country
programmes, and it will help broker global knowledge and experience for national
stakeholders to use.

D. Partnerships
53. Within the context of the COSOP’s SO, IFAD will use partnerships to identify

innovations, strengthen performance, access expertise and services, promote
learning and pave the way for scaling up. At central level, IFAD will continue to
work closely with the DEA, state governments and selected sectoral ministries,19
as well as with research centres and the NITI Aayog. Closer partnerships will be
developed with policy research institutes to support M&E and knowledge
management.

54. The partnership with the NGO community for project implementation at community
level will continue as an intrinsic strength of the IFAD business model. Partnerships
with the private sector to create better business opportunities for farmers,20
particularly at project level, will be an important aspect of the programme.

55. RBA collaboration will be further pursued, and joint action is envisaged in several

states. IFAD will remain an active member of the SDG2 and north-east region
working groups of the United Nations Sustainable Development Framework.
Building on already established relations, collaboration will be nurtured with the
international financial institutions, bilateral organizations and foundations21. These
will be structured principally around opportunities for knowledge-sharing,
cofinancing and scaling up.

E.
56.

Innovations
Innovating, learning from the innovations, and bringing these innovations to scale
are central to IFAD’s offer in India. Innovations will be identified in collaboration

with government and promoted through ongoing and entirely new investments.
Project design processes will actively scout for relevant, scalable innovations. The
sources will include: IFAD’s own experience in India; those it has promoted or
identified in other countries and regions; and innovations developed domestically
by research organizations, NGOs, start-ups, etc.

57. Given that innovations are often about the ''how'' rather than the ''what'', potential

areas may be expected around: climate-proofing agriculture and building
smallholders’ resilience to price/climate shocks; agricultural farm machinery
powered by renewable sources of energy, for reduced drudgery and a lower carbon
footprint; organization of farmers; promoting the public-private-producers
partnerships (4P) model for value chain development; optimizing input use; and
piloting nutrition-sensitive approaches.

F. South-South and Triangular Cooperation
58.

India has a strong SSTC agenda, which IFAD will support through the COSOP and
through incorporating SSTC into the design of new loan and grant projects. SSTC
will be pursued to expand the outreach of India's agricultural expertise while also
enhancing the performance of the country’s agriculture sector. SSTC activities are
likely to cover the following three main activities: (i) sharing knowledge between
India and other developing countries around agriculture and rural development
technologies, policies and processes; (ii) fostering collaborative research between
the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and its network of centres in Asia and
Africa, the CGIAR centres and the IFAD portfolio in the Global South; and
(iii) supporting business-to-business collaboration between Indian enterprises and
start-ups/small and medium-sized enterprises from the Global South to enable
agricultural transformation. These activities will benefit from the role of the
subregional hub as convenor and facilitator of collaborative efforts between the hub
countries. It is worth mentioning here that IFAD and the Government of India are
currently formulating an India-IFAD partnership agreement for SSTC.

Agreement at completion point of last country
programme evaluation

A. Introduction

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

This is the second country programme evaluation (CPE) by the Independent Office
of Evaluation of IFAD (IOE) in the Republic of India since the Fund started its
operations in the country in 1979. The first CPE was completed in 2009 and the
report published in 2010.  The current CPE had two main objectives: (i) assess the
overall partnership between India and IFAD in reducing rural poverty; and (ii)
generate a series of findings and recommendations that will inform the definition of
future cooperation between the Government of the Republic of India and IFAD, as
well as to assist in the implementation of ongoing operations and in the design of
future IFAD-funded projects in the country.

Based on the analysis of the cooperation during the period 2010-2015, the CPE
aims at providing an overarching assessment of: (i) the performance and impact of
programmes and projects supported by IFAD operations; (ii) the performance and
results of IFAD’s non-lending activities in India: policy dialogue, knowledge
management and partnership building; (iii) the relevance and effectiveness of
IFAD’s country strategic opportunities programme (COSOPs) of 2011. This
Agreement at Completion Point (ACP) contains a summary of the main findings
from the CPE (see section B below).

The ACP has been reached between the Government of India (represented by the
Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance) and the IFAD management
(represented by the Programme Management Department) and reflects their
understanding of the main findings from the CPE as well as their commitment to
adopt and implement the recommendations contained in section C, within specified
timeframes.

It is noted that IOE does not sign the ACP, although it facilitates the process
leading up to its conclusion. The implementation of the recommendations agreed
upon will be tracked through the President’s Report on the Implementation Status
of Evaluation Recommendations and Management Actions, which is presented to
the IFAD Executive Board on an annual basis by the Fund’s Management.

This ACP will be included as an annex of the new COSOP for India. In line with the
decision of the Executive Board in 2013, the India CPE will be discussed in the IFAD
Executive Board at the same time when the new India COSOP is considered by the
Board. IOE will prepare written comments on the new COSOP for consideration at
the same Board session, focusing on the extent to which the main findings and
recommendations from the India CPE have been internalized in the new COSOP.

B. Main evaluation findings

Portfolio Performance

6.

Portfolio relevance is assessed as satisfactory. IFAD-funded projects focused on
particularly disadvantaged groups, including the scheduled tribes, scheduled castes,
women and the landless. A considerable portion of the investments were for
agricultural activities. In the past, the technical contents of agricultural
interventions were not always built upon a sound analysis of local farming systems
and did not optimise opportunities to collaborate with local agricultural research and
extension centres. These issues are better acknowledged in recent project designs.
Recent projects have tried to build “convergence” with national rural development
schemes, notably with NRLM and MNREGS and to coordinate with local government
entities (Panchayat Raj Institutions).

9.

Effectiveness is assessed as moderately satisfactory. Results are better
consolidated in community mobilization and infrastructure serving basic needs,
while emerging in two key areas: promoting agricultural production and rural
livelihoods and enabling access to credit and financial services.

Efficiency has been rated moderately unsatisfactory. The main problems have been:
delays in entry into force and in project implementation, reflected in loan
disbursement lags. Looking at the factors that explain delays and sluggish
implementation, on the one side there are the challenging agro-ecologic and socio-
economic conditions of the project areas. On the other hand, there are gaps in the
implementation capacity of state level agencies responsible for the projects.

Rural poverty impact is assessed as satisfactory under the domains of household
assets and income, human and social capital, while moderately satisfactory in food
security, natural resource management and climate change, and institutions and
policies. In several instances, IFAD-funded projects have contributed to raise
income and diversify income sources and helped build assets for the targeted
households. Most projects have been successful at establishing high numbers of
community-based organizations. People are better aware of opportunities to
improve their lives and undertake collective initiatives.

10. Sustainability of benefits is overall assessed as moderately satisfactory due to the
combination of political support, community-based support to the initiatives, and
positive (albeit variable) support from the technical and economic fundamentals. In
the past, design attention to “sustainability” was mostly confined to creating
federations of self-help groups. More recent projects have better acknowledged at
the design stage the need to support in the long-run institutions, human capacities
as well as linkages to markets.

11.

Pro-poor innovation and scaling up is assessed as satisfactory. There has been
progress in introducing improved agricultural technologies and techniques which are
also pertinent to climate change adaptation. There are some recent initiatives on
ICT and commodity value chains and insurance products.

12. There are several examples of scaling up. In Odisha, the state government is
funding the largest share of tribal community development project to expand
outreach to 90,000 households in 1,500 villages. In addition, convergence with
central government schemes is being pursued with MNREGS, NRLM and other
national and state initiatives. In the North Eastern Region, there is an example of a
third phase of a community development project, entirely funded by the central
Government of India, so as to cover new districts.

13. Gender equality and women’s empowerment is assessed as satisfactory. IFAD-

funded projects try to create an enabling environment for women to take part in
village councils, claim rights to agricultural land, access natural resources and
financial services. There is qualitative evidence that intra-family household decision
making now happens in a more participatory form. An increasing number of women
are running for local elections.

14.

Projects have also focused on reducing both household and livelihood related
drudgery. Initiatives include the introduction of smokeless stoves, strengthening
access to drinking water, sanitation and roads, increasing forest cover and access
to fodder.  In Madhya Pradesh, the Tejaswini project cooperated with a state
initiative to introduce initiatives against gambling, alcoholism, domestic violence
which directly affect the welfare of women and their families. The Madhya Pradesh
government plans to scale up this strategy to the entire state.

Non-lending activities

Individual projects and the IFAD country office ran knowledge sharing and learning
initiatives and products (websites, videos, blogs, newsletters, and booklets). Yet,

much of the knowledge from the programme has not been documented or
analysed. In India there is a higher level of expectation from IFAD as a knowledge
broker to help address an expanded range of issues confronting rural poverty.

16. During the evaluation period, the relationship with the central coordinating ministry

(DEA, Ministry of Finance) was cordial and characterized by mutual respect.
However, IFAD has had little engagement with key related technical ministries in
the central government (e.g., Tribal Affairs, Rural Development, and Agriculture).

17. Overall, there is good ownership at the state level: state governments are

responsible for the implementation of IFAD-funded projects and there are cases of
replication of projects or project sub-components funded by state resources (e.g.,
in Odisha and in Madhya Pradesh). The appreciation of the importance of a
sustained relationship with the Panchayat Raj Institutions is emerging. Partnership
with the NGO community for project implementation at the grass roots level has
been an intrinsic strength of the IFAD business model.

18.

19.

IFAD has been involved in UN sponsored cooperative efforts (UN Country team,
UNDAF Task Teams) but fully-fledged programmatic partnerships with UN agencies
are yet to emerge. According to the CPE interviews, multilateral donors such as the
World Bank and Asian Development Bank recognize IFAD’s comparative advantage
and niche in rural poverty alleviation interventions, especially involving the extreme
poor. However, the present level of interaction with IFAD is only one of consultation
during project formulation.

Partnership with the National Agriculture Research System, including state and local
research centres, presents opportunities for availing of the fruit of cutting-edge
research and applying appropriate farming solutions. IFAD-funded projects do not
make adequate use of this resource. An exception is the Integrated Livelihood
Support Project, building cooperative partnerships in Uttarakhand on fruit,
vegetable, milk production. Private sector partnerships are flagged as an important
aspect of IFAD’s strategy and this has been only an emerging area, with some pilot
experiences in Maharashtra and in Uttarakhand.

20. At the state level, some projects usefully contributed to policy-related inputs. For

example, projects in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have provided an input into
the Maharashtra Women’s Policy 2013 and the Madhya Pradesh Vision 2018. There
have also been missed opportunities, as in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh where little
policy dialogue happened on convergence options with public programmes in the
two states.

Strategic (COSOP) performance

21. COSOP relevance is assessed as satisfactory. The COSOP 2011 reflected well the
previous CPE’s findings and recommendations. It maintained IFAD’s focus on the
deeper poverty segments, with a thrust on convergence with public schemes. It had
more explicit recognition for the “technical” side of rain-fed agriculture
development, linkages to markets and processing. It stated two key objectives: (i)
increased access to agricultural technologies and natural resources; and (ii)
increased access to financial services and value chains. These are not only
strategically relevant to the IFAD portfolio but imperatives for agricultural and rural
development, nationally. The 2011 COSOP brought in for the first time the cross-
cutting objective of sharing knowledge and learning on poverty reduction and
nutritional security.

22. COSOP effectiveness is assessed as moderately satisfactory.   As for the first

strategic objective, the programme contributed to productivity increase and risk
management for rain-fed agriculture, albeit with variations between projects. Most
project interventions contributed to increase yields and enhanced risk management
by promoting sustainable agricultural practices, water conservation, agroforestry,

soil fertility management, selected livestock breeds, vaccination campaigns.
Progress is visible across the portfolio, although with implementation delays.

23. With reference to the second strategic objective, propelled by self-help group,

monetary savings and credit linkages have helped beneficiaries invest in circulating
capital, sometimes also fixed capital. Despite good track record of SHGs and
associated borrowers, public sector banks have been extremely cautious before
extending credit support to community-based organizations.

24. The cross-cutting objective of knowledge and learning on poverty reduction and

nutritional security has been partly achieved. In spite of the efforts at project-level
to prepare communication products, there is a gap between the rich experiences on
the ground and the capacity to analyse and systematize them in a way that is
suitable for higher-level policy discussion.

C.  Recommendations

25. The following recommendations are geared towards the preparation of the next

COSOP, through a consultation between the Government of India, IFAD and other
key partners. It is assumed that the future lending envelope for India will remain at
the same level as at present: US$130-140 million per triennium.

26. Recommendation 1. Keep priority to disadvantaged areas and groups but
explore differentiated approaches. Disadvantaged areas will continue to be a
priority in the national rural development context and IFAD has recognized
comparative advantages in disadvantaged areas in India. IFAD-funded interventions
should continue to target disadvantaged areas, particularly in states with large rain-
fed areas, where they can establish effective and innovative approaches for future
replication and scaling up of results. At the national level, it will be important to
avoid excessive geographic spread-out of the portfolio. Given the human resources
available in the IFAD country office, there is a limit to the number of states and
projects that can be effectively supervised. Key recommendations of the previous
CPE continue to be well-grounded such as the general principle of “one state one
loan” and the “saturation” approach (maximizing coverage of a block/district before
moving to the next one).

27. Differentiating the approaches according to the target groups. The future

programme should continue to target disadvantaged communities and groups, with
special attention to women and scheduled tribes. Attention to building and
strengthening social capital should continue. However, in different agro-ecological
and socio-economic contexts, IFAD will face different challenges. The design
approach, component-mix and level of specialisation will need to be adapted.

28. The traditional self-help group paradigm will continue to be relevant for areas and

groups where basic needs, building of grassroots organizations and subsistence
agriculture are still the priority. These are interventions requiring several years of
investments, starting from low economic base and human development conditions.
Instead, in areas where communities are already organized and there is potential
for marketing of surplus production, project designs, in addition to SHGs, should
continue to explore additional approaches to community and group building with
focus on collectively linking to markets and commercialisation (e.g., producers’
groups, mutually-aided cooperative societies and producers’ companies).

Proposed follow-up by the Government and IFAD

29. The new country strategy for India will retain the focus on improving the incomes
and nutrition of the rural poor households whose livelihoods rely on rainfed
agriculture. The country programme will continue to pursue one loan – one state
and the saturation approach. It is worth noting here that the current country
programme demonstrated effective one loan-multiple state operations (such as

NERCORMP II). Under the new country strategy, one loan multiple states operations
would be considered on an exceptional basis particularly for the North East Region
where implementation through a regional agency (NEC) proved satisfactory.  The
Government of India invites IFAD to expand the size of the country office in India in
order to increase the geographic reach and effectiveness of its programme.

30. With regard to the sub-recommendation related to the differentiated approaches

which is more relevant to new projects, the design of IFAD-funded operations will
be informed by poverty and gender analysis studies (current practice) and value
chain studies. The information derived from these studies would help define the
problem/ opportunity statement and therefore the component/ activity mix required
and arrive at approaches that would add value to Government's on-going efforts to
reduce rural poverty, increase agricultural  productivity, and improve farmers'
welfare. Attention will be given to ensure that the projects do not have an unduly
long tenure and that all projects have a well-defined exit strategy.

31. Building social capital will continue to be a key feature of the country programme

and the new strategy. Experience has shown that the Self-Help Group methodology
and its focus on poverty targeting, thrift and credit activities and women
empowerment,  is an effective entry point to building socially cohesive and
autonomous higher-tier organizations. Experience shows that the higher-tier
organizations are now playing an important role in financial intermediation and
development of agricultural services to farmers (input supply,
machinery/equipment hiring centers, and produce aggregation and processing).
The legal entity for the higher-tier organizations will be explored on a case by case
basis to determine the most appropriate set-up in view of the nature of services to
be provided to farmers.

Responsible partners: IFAD, GOI

Timeline: New RB-COSOP covering the period 2017-2021.

32. Recommendation 2. Projects’ agricultural development components need
to focus more prominently on technical solutions for rain-fed agriculture,
especially in light of the climate change, collaborate more with local and
national applied research and extension, and commercialisation of
smallholder agriculture. From a technical perspective, interventions need more
direct emphasis on reducing the large intra-district yield differentials, better analyse
constraints, risks and opportunities of farming systems. There is also a need for
more systematic programme-based partnerships with state and local public
research and extension organizations (e.g., district-level Krishi Vigyan Kendras and
higher research organizations) on technical packages to improve productivity of
crops, fodder, fruit trees and livestock and mitigate weather-related losses.

33. Investments in agriculture need to be crafted more strategically around territorial

and commodity clusters, to better coordinate interventions and concentrate on a
critical mass and streams of initiatives. This will also put projects in a better
position to support linkages to markets and opportunities for value addition. To
improve farmers’ access to information on markets and reduce risks, attention
needs to be paid to expose them to information technology and insurance products.

34. Emphasis on market access and value chains also implies: (i) better market access
and value chain diagnostics upfront to identify the barriers that smallholder farmers
face; (ii) clearer identification of the envisaged role of a project (e.g., enhancing
access to market information; facilitating access to wholesale markets; investing on
improved processing capacity); and (iii) exploring the interest of private sector
operators at the design stage. Recent legislation on reinvesting a percentage of
corporate profits on corporate social responsibility provides new opportunities.

Proposed follow-up by the Government and IFAD

35. The design of new operations will pay more attention to defining clear farming
system and packages of practices (POP) to improve the crop and livestock
production systems and their integration. The supervision and implementation
support of on-going projects will share tested packages of practices that reduce
production costs, promote sustainable methods of agricultural production, and
improve productivity. Expanding the partnership with national applied research and
extension organizations will be pursued more vigorously building on the lessons
learned from the on-going country programme. The successful results from the
IFAD grant programme will be mainstreamed into new or on-going operations
taking into consideration the agro-ecological and socio-economic contexts.  With
the development of IT and Communication tools geared to agriculture, the new and
on-going operations will strive to link farmers with knowledge resource centers, low
cost extension/communication services through IEC and will strive to document
success stories & case studies. The new and on-going projects will also collaborate
with the flagship government programs for water and soil conservation, soil health
management, crop insurance and e-marketing.

36. With regards the sub-recommendations related to the territorial and commodity

clusters and market access, these are well noted. As indicated under the first
recommendation, the detailed component/ activity mix and approach will be based
on the conclusions of the value chain studies and the definition of the
problem/opportunity statement.

Responsible partners: IFAD, GOI.

Timeline: On-going. Recommendation already implemented for the design of the
Drought Mitigation Project in Andhra Pradesh.

37. Recommendation 3. Complementary interventions in non-agricultural
activities are important not only as a measure to diversify rural incomes
(primary production will absorb only a part of the burgeoning youth labour supply in
rural areas) but, equally important, to develop processing and value addition in
agricultural commodity supply chain. In particular, there is scope to better connect
these activities with projects’ agricultural investments (e.g., in the areas of
processing and packaging of products, agricultural tool repair shops, marketing of
agricultural inputs, eco-tourism).

Proposed follow-up by the Government and IFAD

38.

It is important to note that smallholders and marginal farmers currently derive less
than 60% of their incomes from agriculture. Non-agricultural income is therefore an
important complement to the income of rural households. We take note of the CPE
recommendations of connecting the non-farm agricultural activities with the
development of value chains and the services linked with improving the
effectiveness of the forward and backward linkages in the value chain; as well as
targeting youth in such activities. Such activities are already on-going and we will
pursue these efforts both in on-going and future projects , and build on
achievements and lessons learned to date.

Responsible partners: IFAD, GOI.

Timeline: on-going projects; design of new projects under COSOP 2017-2021.

39. Recommendation 4. Portfolio implementation efficiency needs to be

addressed aggressively. A first area of thrust is to simplify project design. This
may entail more conservative plans for project coverage (e.g., fewer blocks or
districts, following a saturation approach). In addition, in particularly disadvantaged
communities (e.g., scheduled tribes), projects could follow a modular approach:

rather than concentrate numerous components and sub-components in a single
project, the intervention could be sequenced in a modular fashion. For example, a
first loan could focus on human and social capital building, support to food self-
sufficiency and sustainable livelihood approach. A follow-up loan could then
emphasise market linkages and support and scaling up in collaboration with public
programmes and local governments (PRIs).

40. The central government, state governments and IFAD should review issues that

cause delays in recruiting the project team, staff turn-over and lengthy
procurement, affecting the pace of implementation, for example: (i) project
personnel recruitment procedures, particularly for senior staff, given the difficulty to
hire staff on deputation from state agencies and programmes; (ii) procurement
procedures and contractual arrangements that have proven to be non-conducive
(e.g., the output-based payment schemes for NGOs); (iii) compensation packages
for project staff, to ensure equal treatment with other public programmes;
(iv) concurrent charges of project directors that compete for their time and focus.
IFAD could further support by preparing guidelines based on previous
implementation experience and training modules on financial management,
procurement and other fiduciary aspects.

Proposed follow-up by the Government and IFAD

41. The efficiency of Portfolio implementation is indeed an area where additional

improvements are required and yet it is also important to take stock of what has
been achieved so far. IFAD and the Government of India have been addressing
efficiency in implementation in a vigorous manner over the last 5 years and the
main results achieved to date are (and reported in the CPE): (i) the time from
approval to first disbursement has decreased from 16.2 months to 9.5 months for
the last 5 projects; (iii) the volume of disbursement has doubled from approx. 11
million USD in 2010 to 23 million USD in 2015; (iv) the number of problem projects
has reduced from 5 to 2 over the period 2010-2015. We plan to build on these
results to further improve the programme implementation efficiency with special
focus on: (i) ensuring that the project design process further meets the DEA and
IFAD readiness conditions for start-up in order to reduce the period from board
approval to first disbursement ; (ii) ensuring that experienced candidates are
designated as project directors as their competency, their personality and their full
time responsibility for the project are a determining factor for project efficiency and
effectiveness; (iii) streamlining project management in terms of delegation of
authority and staffing; (iv) working on effective mechanisms for the release of loan
proceeds by State Governments.

42. Based on the consultation with programme stakeholders at the CPE roundtable, it

was agreed that additional measures to improve efficiency would cover: (i) simplify
project design in line with recommendations 1 and 2 above; (ii) provide hands-on
and systematic capacity building to project management units on project planning,
M&E, financial management and procurement especially in the start-up phase; (iii)
plan start-up workshops in such a manner so as to facilitate sharing knowledge
between design and implementation teams on project rationale and modalities of
implementation; (iv) allow for sufficient time during the first year for detailed
planning of implementation, undertaking required staffing and procurement, setting
up the financial management and M&E systems; (v) ensure that appropriate
delegation of authority is provided to PMU and that employment conditions are
competitive so that qualified staff are attracted to the job, motivated and retained.
It is also agreed that all new and on-going operations will have a computerized
financial management system.

43.

It is worth noting that despite issues in implementation efficiency, the projects are
effectively reaching their objectives : once the implementation systems are in
place, the projects quickly achieve very good coverage of the beneficiaries and

become very good at mobilizing community participation, bank financing and
convergence with Government programs and this somewhat compensates for
delayed disbursement of IFAD funds. The projects are subsequently scaled up by
the State Government.

Responsible partners: IFAD, GOI.

Timeline: On-going

44. Recommendation 5. Strengthen partnerships and non-lending activities at
four levels: state government, central government, private actors and the
rural finance sub-sector and south-south cooperation. There are four main
levels of action, each requiring slightly different partners and skills. First, at the
state level, project partnerships and experiences could be supported by analytical
work to provide inputs into policy design and revision and pave the way for benefits
to reach a larger number of people.

45. Second, at the central level, building on previous state-level experiences, lessons of

processes and experiences could be distilled at a higher level and shared with
central-level authorities and international development partners, including RBAs
and International Financial Institutions in a number of fora.

46. Third, the private sector needs to be involved more prominently at the time of the
new COSOP preparation and project design. Pilot experiences of CAIM and ILSP
with private operators need to be analysed more in detail to extract lessons and
approaches. The rural finance sub-sector needs more attention given the so far
limited responsiveness in financing village groups. In addition to working with
private microfinance entities, the experience of MPOWER with publicly-owned banks
deserves dissemination.

47. Fourth, experiences need to be shared with other countries in the sub-region (and
beyond). The sub-regional mandate of the IFAD country office in India creates
fertile ground for south-south knowledge exchanges. Beyond the sub-region, there
should be central-level efforts from IFAD headquarters to facilitate strategic
initiatives of South-South cooperation from a global perspective.

Proposed follow-up by the Government and IFAD

48. The country programme is already active at state level in disseminating successful
experiences to state authorities which in turn scale these up and the CPE has
confirmed the policy impact and scaling up at state level. Knowledge and policy
related activities at national level are addressed under the sixth recommendation.
Private sector is increasingly consulted at project design and supervision and as
recommended by the CPE, IFAD is in the process of documenting the successful
private sector and bank linkage activities of the portfolio. With regard to the sub-
regional mandate of the country office in India, a work plan was already developed
for knowledge sharing and is under implementation. IFAD has just provided a grant
to a regional organization, South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and
Environment, to define the engagement with the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation community and this is likely to strengthen cooperation within
this sub-region. The Government of India is also in the process of developing its
South-South cooperation strategy and IFAD will contribute to the key areas of
relevance to its mandate and competencies, within the available resources.

Responsible partners: IFAD

Timeline: On-going

49. Recommendation 6. Enhance capacity and resources for non-lending

activities. At present, non-lending activities are constrained by limited in-house
technical expertise and budget. Within the current resource profile, some
improvements could be made by exploring the following options: (i) embedding

knowledge management and policy dialogue components in individual loan project
financing; (ii) using the already existing opportunity of periodic tripartite meetings
to discuss selected sectoral/thematic issues and facilitate knowledge transfer across
projects; (iii) mobilising additional funding from external sources (e.g., national,
international foundations).

50. IFAD also needs to demonstrate capacity of strategic thinking and to bring

specialised technical skills to the table. Partnerships with reputed national and
international high-calibre specialists and think tanks would enhance quality and
credibility of policy analysis. IFAD could consider creating an engagement forum
comprising of researchers/scholars and practitioners, commission think pieces on
issues of priority and convene with the government an annual or bi-annual high
profile event. This would require IFAD Headquarter engagement and support
including a moderate allocation of additional resources.

Proposed follow-up by the Government and IFAD

51. The implementation of this recommendation is already on-going. Inclusion of

knowledge management and policy dialogue activities in every individual project
may not be relevant. Therefore, the Government of India believes that the issue of
inclusion of KM and policy dialogue may be need based and should be included in a
particular project only if necessary and in consultation with the Government.

52.

In terms of knowledge management, the more recent projects, have expanded the
activities in this field and are very active in the production of communication
materials, training materials, case studies as illustrated by CAIM, ILSP and LAMP.
There is also agreement on using the TPRM as a knowledge sharing platform.
Within the next country strategy , and given the limitations on resources and time
of staff, and the existence of several well recognized policy fora, IFAD plans to
engage with the existing fora as well as existing Government-donor policy platforms
(such as the work that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
and the World Bank are conducting on the policy options for agricultural
development). IFAD will strive to mobilize additional resources to the extent
possible , with the approval of GOI, to support relevant policy dialogue.

Responsible partners: IFAD and GOI.

COSOP preparation process including preparatory
studies, stakeholder consultation and events

COSOP preparation process including preparatory studies, stakeholder
consultation and events

The design team of the COSOP. The COSOP design was anchored by Ms. Aissa Touré ,
Programme Officer, Asia and Pacific Division, with contribution from all the members of
the IFAD country team including Ms. Rasha Omar, Country Programme Manager and
Country Representative, Ms. Meera Mishra, Country Coordinator, Mr Vincent Darlong,
Country Programme Officer, Mr. Sriram Sankarasubramaniam, Programme Support
Analyst, Ms. Mehry Ismaili, Programme Assistant.

The Lead Advisor for the COSOP is Mr Edward Heinemann. The IFAD HQ CPMT is
composed of Mr. Nigel Brett, Lead Portfolio Advisor, APR; Mr. Fabrizio Bresciani, Regional
Economist, APR; Mr. Thomas Chalmers, Consultant, APR; Mr. Roshan Cooke, Regional
Climate and Environment Specialist, ECD; Ms. Antonella Cordone, Senior Technical
Specialist - Indigenous Peoples and Tribal Issues, PTA ; Ms. Waafa El Khoury, Senior
Technical Specialist – Agronomy, PTA; Mr. Antonio Rota, Senior Technical Specialist –
Livestock, PTA; Mr. Mattia Prayer Galletti, Senior Technical Specialist - Rural
Development and Institutions, PTA; Ms. Juliane Friedrich, Senior Technical Specialist –
Nutrition, PMD. In addition, the COSOP design team also benefitted from the support of
Mr. Tom Chalmers, who carried out an in-depth stock take of rural poverty in India as
well as a review of the constraints and opportunities for rainfed agriculture.

Preparatory studies. The major preparatory study was a desk-based Environment and
Climate Change Assessment carried out for India and initiated in last quarter of 2015 and
completed during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, a study was commissioned on the
modalities for convergence with Government programs in the rural and agricultural
sector. An in-depth stock-taking of the COSOP results was undertaken in first quarter of
2017 and led to a comprehensive mapping of the results of the previous COSOP against
its targets. This is reflected in the COSOP Completion Report. A literature review was also
conducted for the agricultural sector. These studies were further complemented by recent
policy and strategy documents developed by the Government of India, notably the 3 year
action agenda 2017-18, Agricultural Marketing and Farmer Friendly Reforms Across
Indian States and UTs, Doubling Farmers' Incomes, Raising Agricultural Productivity and
Making Farming Remunerative for Farmers, all produced by Niti Aayog. The Niti Aayog
publications present the outline of the Government strategic plan for the country's social
and economic transformation in the short and medium term.

COSOP consultations. The COSOP design team took advantage of key events in the
country programme to discuss future strategic directions for IFAD in India. The key
events that have contributed to shape the current COSOP are :

-

Initial COSOP consultation held after the CPE workshop in May 2016.
Participants in this consultation included the representatives of DEA and Ministry
of Agriculture, the management teams of IFAD supported projects in India,
representatives of UN and multilateral development banks.  The overall focus of
the country programme on climate resilient agriculture and market access was
broadly endorsed. Participants however raised the following issues : maintaining
the empowerment approach and development of robust community institutions;
addressing challenges and opportunities of rural youth in rural areas.

The Tripartite Portfolio Meetings which are held on a bi-annual basis and
which provide feedback on the GoI assessment of project performance, areas of
improvement and future expectations. The two  TPRM held during the COSOP
design period were attended by representatives of DEA, Ministry of DONER, and
project directors. During the TPRM, held in March 2017 in Jharkand, the Secretary
Welfare Dept attended the meeting. The discussions brought to the forefront the
issue of IFAD value added to agricultural and rural development in the country.
Main areas of strength for IFAD are institutional development of community
organizations with strong focus on their inclusive representation of the poor and
financial sustainability; and financial inclusion and expanding access of the poor to
financial services especially from private banks.  Main areas of improvement are
the evidence based knowledge and program design and implementation ;
systematically capturing the good practices of specific projects and mainstreaming
these within the program and exploring their scale up through Government
programs.

- Bilateral meetings held with DEA, with Ministry of Agriculture and

Farmers' Welfare, and with Ministry of Development of the North East
Region, and the North East Council to confirm the overall strategic focus.
During these meetings aspects of IFAD value added were discussed and the
following features of IFAD business model are appreciated : flexibility and
successfully tested community driven approaches to empower and enable
communities in remote and conflict prone areas to improve their livelihoods.
Discussions with DEA have focused on developing solutions to address the causes
that lead to weak programme efficiency which was rated moderately
unsatisfactory by the Country Programme Evaluation. Such solutions include
tightening the provisions in the state agreements to clarify the roles and
responsibilities of the State Government in ensuring the successful
implementation of the projects; training of project directors on project
management; setting in-depth project reviews after 18months from entry into
force to review project performance and revise the project design, institutional
arrangements and fund flow mechanisms as appropriate.

- New round of Consultations with Indian Council of Agricultural Research,
IFAD supported Projects, Multilateral agencies and private sector. Two
such consultations were held on 14 and 23 June, 2017, in Delhi. The discussions
focused on validating the proposed strategic objectives, IFAD value added to the
development of the agricultural and rural sectors in India and proposed innovation
agenda. The participants found that the economic centric approach underlying the
new COSOP is aligned with the Government new approach to the agricultural and
rural sectors. They also advised to focus IFAD programme on areas where
comparatively low investments can yield high impact. The participants pointed to
the existence of  many initiatives led by Government and development partners in
the space of climate resilient agriculture and farmers' access to markets and that
potential for partnership should be  mapped systematically. Despite this, certain
gaps exist and IFAD may consider addressing these, such as : systematic use of
the tools developed to better aid in planning and building producers'  resilience to
drought; the quality of planting material especially for horticulture and
agroforestry; credit financing of sub-sectors such as agro-forestry; how to ensure
that the environmental footprint of livestock is reduced; prevention of zoonotic
diseases especially transboundary diseases; mitigating antibiotic microbial
resistance in livestock and humans which puts the attention squarely on the food

safety agenda; phasing out banned agrochemicals from the market in India and
their use by farmers; use of warehousing to reduce farmers'  risks with regard the
price volatility; development and improvement of ecosystem  services.
Participants also cautioned on investment in renewable energy which stop proving
profitable when the electricity  grid is extended. There was also strong demand
from the participants for IFAD to step up its knowledge management role and
better capitalize on the learning from its diverse portfolio. The ICAR and CGIAR
centers  expressed their interest in SSTC and use of the regional grants
accordingly.

Natural resources management and climate change
adaptation: Background, national policies and IFAD
intervention strategies

1.

2.

India accounts for 4.5 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases. A decline in
monsoon rainfall has already been observed, since the 1950s. The frequency of
heavy rainfall events has also increased and a  2°C rise in the world’s average
temperatures will make India’s summer monsoon highly unpredictable. India is
therefore at forefront of efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change.

Climate change is expected to affect hydrological balances, input supplies, livestock
production, and other components of agricultural systems. Recent studies shows
that wheat yields peaked in India around 2001 and have not increased since
despite increasing fertilizer applications. Observations show that extremely high
temperatures in northern India - above 34°C - have had a substantial negative
effect on wheat yields, and rising temperatures can only aggravate the situation.
Seasonal water scarcity, rising temperatures, and intrusion of sea water would
threaten crop yields, jeopardizing the country’s food security. Should current trends
persist, substantial yield reductions in both rice and wheat can be expected in the
near and medium term. Under 2°C warming by the 2050s, the country may need to
import more than twice the amount of food-grain than would be required without
climate change.

National policy context

3.

4.

The broad policy framework on environment and climate change is laid down in the
National Environment Policy (NEP) 2006, which promotes sustainable development
along with respect for ecological constraints and the imperatives of social justice.
The current development paradigm reiterates the focus on sustainable growth and
aims to exploit the co-benefits of addressing climate change along with promoting
economic growth. The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) provides a
sharper focus on required interventions. Currently, NAPCC is implemented through
eight National Missions, outlining priorities for mitigation and adaptation to combat
climate change.

On 2 October 2016, India ratified the Paris Agreement. India ‘s Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC) targets to lower the emissions intensity of GDP by
33%–35% by 2030 below 2005 levels; increase the share of non-fossil based power
generation capacity to 40% of installed electric power capacity by 2030; and to
create an additional (cumulative) carbon sink of 2.5–3 GtCO2e through additional
forest and tree cover by 2030. The NDCs will be fulfilled through 8 missions under
the NAPCC22. The continuing rapid growth in renewable energy in India, combined
with sustained reductions in coal imports is a strong indication that the low carbon
transformation of India’s energy supply sector is gathering momentum. The list of
technologies/practices identified as having mitigation and adaptation co-benefits
are as follows:

22 National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojna (PKVY), Pradhan Mantri Krishi
Sinchayee Yojna (PMKSY), Sub-Mission on Agroforestry (SMAF), National Initiative for Climate Resilience Agriculture (NICRA),
National Food Security Mission, Soil Health Card Scheme (SHC), Mission for Development of Integrated Horticulture (MIDH).

IFAD’s Climate adaptation strategy
5.

IFAD would consciously mainstream climate change adaptation with a set of
complementary activities and investments that are specifically aimed at climate risk
management and improving the adaptation capacity of households to cope with
these adverse weather events. It would require integrating climate vulnerability
assessment and adaptation planning in IFAD’s projects- through : (i) specific
bottom-up village participatory community planning processes, (ii) biophysical and
socio-economic resource mapping to better understand the environmental and
climate risk issues within the village and options for their mitigation, (iii)
vulnerability assessment and mapping of vulnerability and local adaptive capacities
that build on the participatory resource mapping, (iv) participatory gender-
differentiated village adaptation action planning to define community land and
water management and climate adaptation investments to reduce vulnerability,
increase resilience and enhance the adaptive capacity of the local communities; and
(v) a participatory monitoring system to inform multi-sectoral planning
methodologies. Targeted investments would be specifically designed for integrating
climate change adaptation into natural resource management, enhancing
agricultural diversity and cropping systems, livelihood and income generation and
poverty reduction programs, and the maintenance of environmental services

important for ensuring reliable and assured water supply and natural resource
based livelihoods and agricultural production systems.

Enhanced knowledge capacities of local communities to address climate change
impacts, documentation and dissemination of best practices, and capacity
development support to district and local level entities would enable better
provision of climate relevant information to local farmers and households to
complement adaptation measures. Support to research for developing new cropping
systems and stress resistant species; to national and district level for developing
policy related information on climate change adaptation, management of climate
change, and strengthening mechanisms of coordination across sectors and agencies
and adaptation financing are important for enhancing responses to climate change.

These initiatives will benefit from a conducive enabling environment as the
Government of India has enacted a number of policies that improve resilience to
climate change in the agriculture sector. Chief among them are : the national
agroforestry mission formulated in 2014 to encourage the expansion of tree
plantation and make it a commercially viable and environmentally sustainable
enterprise; integration of different programmes of water sector in one common
platform to ensure end to end solution in irrigation management; specific thrust on
organic farming; e-NAM to create a unified national market for agricultural
commodities; management of crop residues; monitoring of soil health and
rationalizing input use thanks to the soil health card; judicious use of urea through
neem coating; improved safety net mechanisms ; formulation of district agriculture
contingency plans to allow timely implementation of preventive and remedial
measures to reduce damage caused by climate shocks.

Concept Note on:
India: Scaling Up Renewable Energy Based
Agricultural Technologies for Empowering Smallholder Farming
Families in India

A. Strategic context and rationale for IFAD involvement,

commitment and partnership

1.
The Government of India has set the ambitious goal of doubling farmers' incomes
by 2022 in real terms. A number of integrated interventions are required to achieve this
goal.  The  Agricultural  Engineering  Division  of  Indian  Council  of  Agricultural  Research
(ICAR) proposes to contribute to this goal through:

Mechanization  of  agricultural  operations.  In  India,  energy  use  in  agriculture  is
estimated  at  2-2.25  kW/ha,  which  is  very  low  when  compared  with  other
countries. Absolute mechanization of agricultural sector would require a fourfold
increase  from  current  levels,  and  would  encompass  both  production  and
processing  operations.  Achieving  higher
level  of  mechanization  among
smallholders while maintaining a low carbon pathway would entail promotion of
technological  innovations  better  suited  to  smallholders  and  higher  use  of
renewable energy sources.

Support  small  holder  farmers  in  better  price  realization.  This  will  be  achieved
through  the  introduction  of  appropriate  technologies  for  on-farm  value  addition
that can  operate  on  various  energy  sources  and  help  manage  processing  and
storage costs, and reduce crop losses;

Facilitate  the  development  of  supply  chains  of  agricultural  technologies  that
cater  to  smallholders  and  create  a  business  model  for  long  term  sustainability.
ICAR  aims  to  remove  the  bottlenecks  that  hinder  taking  technological
innovations  from  the  laboratories  to  the  markets,  and  to  help  manufacturer’s
access  financial  services/  skilled  labour/  government  incentives  to  produce  and
sell the technologies at scale.

Moreover,  and  according  to  action  tracker  of  Intended  Nationally  Determined
2.
Contributions  to  reduce  Green  House  Gas  emissions  (INDC),  India  is  on  the  path  to
achieve  the  targets  for  the  use  of  renewable  energy  in  power  generation  and  to  over
achieve  the  emissions  intensity  target  submitted  under  the  Paris  Agreement.  ICAR
proposes  to  contribute  to  this  INDC,  by  promoting  agricultural  technologies  that  use
renewable  energy;  and  enable  farmers  to  switch  from  dependence  on  fossil  fuels  to  the
use  of  renewable  sources  of  energy  or  hybrid  systems  (conventional  and  renewable
energy).  Access  and  availability  of  fossil  fuel  based  energy  in  remote  rural  areas  are
irregular and come at a higher cost, hence in remote and off-grid rural areas, renewable
energy technologies will be accepted as more affordable than fossil fuel based ones.

B. Possible geographic area of intervention and target groups

3.
Geographic area. The project aims to cover eight states of India. Potential states
for the project are Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Tamil Nadu
and  Karnataka.  The  basis  for  identifying  the  states  was  (i)  large  population  likely  to  be
off  grid  (ii)  pre-existing  strong  community  based  institutions  that  could  serve  as  a
platform  to  reach  out to  the  communities  ;  (iii)  states  with  scope  for  uptake  of  the
proposed ICAR technologies as they are lagging in agricultural productivity23; (iv) states
with  strong  research  capacity  and  achievements  in  agricultural  machinery  and
equipment.  Within  these  states,  preference  would  be  given  to  locations  with  :  1)
evidence of strong agricultural extension system organized around Agriculture extension
centres,  NGOs,  State  Rural  Livelihood  Missions,  cooperatives/  farmers'  organizations,
lead  farmers  and  community resource  persons;  2)  presence  of  IFAD  supported  projects
having  established  well-functioning  producer  organizations  and  farmers'  service  centers
(as of March 2018, there are 260 grassroots organizations in IFAD portfolio in the States
of Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand). Within these locations, priority will be given to areas that
have  irregular  access  to  electricity  or  are  off-grid. Given  the  geographic  scale  of  the
project  area,  implementation  will  follow  a  modular  approach  and  during  design  the
gradual roll out of the project will be planned accordingly.

as scientists/ innovators working on developing new technologies for farm machinery and
equipment.  Women and youth will form a significant part of all these groups, not just as
beneficiaries  but  also  as  potential  partners  in  implementation. In  line  with  the  COSOP
focus on rainfed farming systems, rainfed agricultural areas will be selected.

Outreach. The project plans to reach 1 million smallholder and marginal farmers
in  4000  Gram  Panchayats  in  8  states,  as  direct  beneficiaries;  and  about  5  million
smallholders as indirect beneficiaries.

C. Justification and rationale
6.
Up  to  2016/17,  ICAR  filed  for  the  patent  of  1025  technologies  by  69  research  institutions.
However,  the  technology  developed  in  ICAR  laboratories  does  not  reach  the  farmers'  fields  in  the
same  pace.  For  example,  according  to  the  available  information in  the  annual  reports  of  ICAR  for
2015-16  &  2016-17,  only  104  technologies  were  licensed.  This  situation  is  due  to  the  following
reasons:

The  technologies  developed  by  ICAR  are  demonstrated  in  farmer  fields,  but  it  is  done  on  a
small scale. This is due to the fact that the budget allocated for demonstration is limited. Due
to  limited  fund  availability,  higher  share  of  contribution  from  the  farmer  is  required  to
demonstrate  and  adopt  the  technology.  Smallholder  farmers  are  generally  not  able  to
contribute to that level, which limits the demonstration of the technology.  Hence, awareness
and adoption of new technologies among farmers are limited in scale.
The new technology does not fall under the subsidy schemes announced by Government and
credit is not readily available for such technologies. Thus it limits the up-take by smallholders
and  the  subsequent  manufacture  of  the  technology  at  scale.  This  is  particularly  true  for
renewable energy based/ hybrid technology24.
The  technology  developed  is  crop  and  region  specific  and  thus  the  demand  may  be  much
localized.  This  usually  dissuades  agricultural  equipment  manufacturers,  who  look  for  volume
and economies of scale.

23 This refers mainly to the Eastern States of Bihar, Jharkand, Odisha and Chattisgarh.
24 Subsidy is currently available only on solar powered irrigation pumps.

EB 2018/124/R.19

The practice of custom hiring to make the technology more widely available at an affordable
cost,  is  not  prevalent  in  all  states  and  where  prevalent  usually  includes  generic  machines/
technologies.  Small  and  medium  manufacturers  face  difficulty  in  accessing  unorganized
farmers and rely on word of mouth to sell their technology. This impacts their outreach and
the scale of the business.
Small holders require farm technologies for enhancing their productivity as well as
reducing  post-harvest  losses  and  increasing  their  price  realisation;  but  they
neither  have  the  information  about,  nor  the  access to,  these  technologies.  The
importance  of  renewable  energy  based/  hybrid  technologies  is  dual  :  enable
access to electrical power and clean energy for farmers who live in remote and off
grid areas ; reduce cost of production.

The proposed project aims to bridge this gap between research in labs and needs
7.
of farmers in the field by using the existing platforms of farmers’ organisations and other
collectives  to  demonstrate and  validate technology, and  create  a  demand  as  well  as
engaging manufacturers, thereby creating a sustainable business model for promotion of
agriculture technology for small holders with a focus on renewable energy based/ hybrid
technology.  This  is  expected  to  enable  smallholders  to  move  out  of  poverty  and  double
their  agricultural  incomes  through  the  following  pathway:  the  mechanization 25of
agricultural  operations  (production,  harvest,  post-harvest,  storage  and  processing)  and
the  use  of  agricultural  by-products  as  sources  of  renewable  energy,  would  increase
smallholder  productivity,  ensure  timeliness  of  agricultural  operations,  reduce  post-
harvest losses, and ensure higher price realization for farmers, while maintaining a lower
carbon footprint.

D. Key Project Objectives

8.
The  project's goal is to  enable  the  rural  poor  to  overcome  poverty  through
remunerative  farming  activities.    The  project development objective is  to  increase
smallholder farmers’ productivity and income by adoption of affordable technologies that
use renewable or hybrid sources of energy.

9.
The project is aligned with the strategic objective of the RB-COSOP (2018-2024)
which  states  "Smallholder  food  and  agricultural  production  systems  are  remunerative,
sustainable, and resilient". The project will contribute to two dimensions of the strategic
objective  of  the  IFAD  country  programme  in  India  :  (i)  remunerative  by  promoting
mechanization to improve returns to labour , and processing of agri-products to improve
price realization ; (ii) resilient by ensuring that operations are timely implemented given
the limited window for effecting different cultural operations as a result of climate change
,  and  by  adopting  a  low  carbon  pathway  for  agriculture  thanks  to  the  use  of  renewable
energy.

E. Scaling up

10.
The  project  will  scale  up    (i)the  custom  hiring centres  and  the  farmers'  one  stop
shops that have been already developed and tested but are still at limited scale especially
in areas where rainfed farming predominates;  (ii) the Government's start-up incubation
programs by allowing successful start-ups to access larger market for their products; (iii)
the use of machinery and equipment powered by renewable sources of energy or hybrid
energy across the various cultural practices pre- and post-harvest. The project approach
has also the potential to be further scaled up through Government schemes and private
investments  related  to  access  to  clean  energy  and  promotion  of  value  addition  of
agricultural products.

25 This project would not address variety improvement or improved package of agronomic practices as these activities are
already under-way among organized producers' groups. This project will principally address technologies in form of machinery
and equipment that would improve labour productivity, reduce post-harvest losses, and improve productive use of agricultural
waste.

F. Ownership, Harmonization and Alignment

11.
The project is aligned with the national goal of doubling farmers' incomes in real
terms  by 2022  and  with  the  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  to  reduce
Green  House  Gas  emissions  (INDC).  During  discussions  with  the  Ministry  of  New  and
Renewable  Energy,  the  Mission  for  Integrated  Development  of  Agriculture  and  the
Ministry of Food Processing Industries, areas of complementarity were identified between
their  on-going  schemes  and  the  proposed  project.  Main  aspects  that  make  this  project
distinct  from  on-going  schemes  is  :  its  focus  on  promoting  mechanization  of  farm  and
post-harvest operations among smallholder and marginal farmers; its last mile delivery;
and  the  fact  that  it  promotes  the  use  of  renewable  energy  across  different  agricultural
operations (production, post-production, irrigation and waste/biomass management).

G. Components and activities

12.

The project will have 3 components as described below :

1) Component  1:  Participatory  development  of  agri-technologies:  Under  this
component, a comprehensive system will be evolved to facilitate smooth transition of
technologies  from  lab  to  the  farms  capitalizing  on  smallholders’  need/  demand  for
new  technologies  in  areas  such  as  production,  harvest,  post-harvest,  storage  &
processing  and  agricultural  residue  management  etc.  It  will  consist  of  the  following
activities :

a. Selection  of  existing  producer  organizations under  IFAD  supported
projects,  Krishi  Vigyan  Kendras  (KVKs)26,  NGOs,  government  schemes.
Producer  organizations  may  include  livelihood  collectives,  federations  of
SHGs,  Producer  Companies,  Cooperatives  etc.  The  project  will  select
producers' organizations  with  strong  social  cohesion,  good  field  presence,
good  systems  for  governance,  basic  input  and output  aggregation  activities
or  custom  hiring  services. Producers'  organizations  would  be  operating  in
rainfed areas.

b. Assessment of the smallholders' technological needs based on analysis
of  the  constraints  in  labour  productivity  and  in  timely  implementation  of
operations,  effective  irrigation/storage/  processing  practices  as  well  as
management  of  agricultural  waste.  The  project  will  adopt  a  gendered
analysis in assessing technological needs of smallholder farmers. The project
will  also  assess  the  cost  and  regularity  of  supply  of  fuel  and  electricity  to
determine best energy solutions for the proposed technologies..

c. Organizing  demonstration  of technologies  developed  by  ICAR  and
trial  of  machinery/  equipment.  Based  on  the  technological  needs  of
smallholders, the project will organize demonstration, extension services and
trial  of  the  machinery/  equipment  with  the  farmers'  organizations.  The
technologies will be assessed during the demonstration/ trial stage in terms
of:  i)  productivity under  rainfed  conditions;  ii)  reduction  in  input  costs;  iii)
reduction  in  greenhouse  gas  emission;  iv)  level  of  acceptance  of  the

and  FOSS,  book-keeping  for  CHC  and  FOSS,  and  training  of  the  CHC/FOSS
workforce  on  management  of  CHC/FOSS  and  operation/maintenance  of
equipment/  machinery.    The project  will  also  support  the  Farmers'
Organizations  to  benefit  from  Government  schemes  supporting  CHC/FOSS
and  to  mobilize  bank  financing  as  required.  As  a  result  of  this  support,
Farmers'  Organizations  will  be  able  to  run  custom  hiring  centers  and
farmers' one stop shops in a financially viable manner.

e. Contract  between  Farmers'  Organizations  and  manufacturers.  The
project  will  facilitate  the  establishment  of  a  contractual  arrangement
between the Farmers' Organizations and the manufacturers for the purchase
and servicing of equipment/ machinery and training of farmers' on their use.
The  Farmers'  organizations  will  be  able  to  hire  out  the  equipment/
machinery to their members.

f. Convergence  plan  for  each  Farmers'  Organizations  for  agriculture
mechanization. The  project  will  assist  each  of  the  selected  Farmers'

from

Component  2  :  Development  of  the  supply  chain  and  a  business
2)
model  for  technologies  from  labs  to  markets:    This  component  will  focus  on
developing commercially viable solutions for the licensing, manufacture and sale of
technologies developed by ICAR. The main activities are:

a. Short  listing  the  technologies  developed  by  ICAR  engineering
network  for  licensing and  which  are  relevant  to  producers'  requirements
as  identified  under  component  1  above.  Shortlisted  technologies  would
demonstrate  clear  gains  in  terms  of  savings  in  labour,  post-harvest  losses,
input costs and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The project will shortlist
the  technologies  that  are  ready  for  licensing  as  they  proved  to  be  relevant
and  affordable;  they  reduced  women  drudgery;  and they  generated
acceptance from farmers during the demonstrations.

b. Licensing  the  technology.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  technology
demonstrations as reported in component 1, and short listing of technologies
ready  for  licensing,  the  project  will  facilitate  the  licensing  of  the  ICAR
technologies to interested manufacturers and provide the full information for
each technology in terms of the scale and results of the demonstrations and
equipment/  machinery  trials  with  farmers'  organizations. The  project  will
carry  out  an  exhaustive  assessment  of  the  manufacturers  operating  in
project  locations  as  well  as  at  district  and  state  levels,  and  the  start-ups
supported by the ARYA and AGRI UDAAN schemes of ICAR, to determine the
scope and scale of their business. This will allow the issuance of expression
of  interest  for  the  licensing  of  those  ICAR  technologies  that  have  better
uptake and marketability and are better targeted. The project will also work
closely with Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) on the norms of
renewable energy technologies developed by ICAR.

c. Commercializing the technology. Following the principles of Public Private
Producers  Partnerships  (4P),  the  project  will  develop  a  specific  support
package  for small and medium enterprises that purchase the license of the
ICAR technology with the aim to produce smallholder technology and market
it  among  smallholder  farmers.  The  support  package  will  be  for  a  two  year
period and include: 1) formulation of a business plan for the manufacture of
the  technology  distribution/dealership  and  marketing,  as  well  as  technical
assistance  to  farmers  and  after  sales  services;  2)  preparing  the  financing
package  that  would  include    manufacturers'  own  contribution,  a  loan  from
the bank, and a grant element from the project. The project will also support

6)  support  to  the  manufacturers  in  carrying  out  market  studies  to  expand
their outreach and sales to farmers and Farmers' Organizations; 7) ensuring
flow  of  information  between  farmers'  groups  and  manufacturers  to  enable
technology refinement ; 8) monitoring the manufacturers' implementation of
the business plan and regular repayment of the loan.

3) Component  3  :  Project  Management: The  project  will  be  managed  by  the
Agricultural  Engineering  Division  of  ICAR.  This  will  be  done  through  a  dedicated
Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  housed  in  the  Division.  In  each  project  state,  a
state level PMU will be formed for managing implementation and will be supported
by a committee comprising the ICAR centres, KVKs, NGOs, Farmers' Organizations
and  IFAD  financed  projects  to  implement  the  project  activities  under  component
1. With regard to Component 2, Zonal Technology Management Units of ICAR will
draw  on  their  business  development  skills  and  will  work  closely  with  the  ICAR
centres,  originators  of  the  technological  innovations,  and  the  manufacturers
interested in the license of the technology. This component also includes building
laboratory  facilities  in  the  participating  ICAR  centres  as  required;  training  and
capacity  building  of  researchers  and  scientists  on  participatory  technology
development;  exposure  visits,  conferences  and  collaborative  research  involving
national and international partners with the aim to transfer tested technologies to
other  similar  agro-ecological  zones  and  production  systems  in  the  global  South,
and  to  adapt  technologies  developed  by  other  countries  in  India.  Knowledge
Management will form a critical part of the project both for informing programme
implementation  and  for  policy  inputs  based  on  experiences  of  farmers  adopting
technologies.

H. Preliminary Environmental and Social category

The project could be classified as category B project. The proposed project aims to
13.
encourage the use of clean/renewable energy sources for agriculture purposes, which will
address  the  twin  aspects  of  low  level  of  mechanization  in  smallholder  farming  and  high
carbon  footprint  of  smallholder  agriculture  due  to  usage  of  conventional  sources  of
energy. The project will also promote the use of existing solar panels established through
government  schemes  for  promotion  of  solar  water  pumps,  to  fuel  other  agricultural
technologies  for  the  farmers.  This  in  turn  will  reduce  over  exploitation  of  ground  water
and optimise the use of solar energy being produced.

I. Preliminary Climate Risk classification

14.
The climate risk classification of the project is moderate. As indicated above, the
project  will  promote  renewable  sources of  energy  which  contribute  to  reducing
greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  therefore  mitigate  climate  change,  in  rainfed  agriculture
system which are particularly vulnerable to climate change.

J. Costs and financing

The total project cost is estimated at 200 million USD and the IFAD contribution is
15.
a  loan  of  90  million  USD  and  an  in-loan  grant  of  1  million  USD.  The  Government
contribution  is  estimated  at  109  million  USD  in  terms  of  staff  salary,  infrastructure,
laboratory,  manufacturing  facility,  and  convergence  with  Government  schemes  and
programs.  The  share  of  the  private  sector  in  total  project  financing  is  yet  to  be
estimated.

K. Organization and management

16.
The  Lead  Project  Agency  will  be  the  Indian  Council  of  Agricultural  Research
(ICAR). It  is  worth  mentioning here  that  ICAR  managed externally  funded  projects,
particularly the National Agricultural Higher Education Project (on-going) and the National
Agricultural  Innovation  Project  (closed),  both  financed  by  the  World  Bank  with  loan
financing of 82.5_million USD and 200 million USD respectively.

17.
The project will be managed on a day to day basis by the Agricultural Engineering
Division of ICAR. This will be done through a dedicated Project Management Unit (PMU)
in  the  Division  which  will  include  a  multidisciplinary team.  The  PMU  in  the  Engineering
Division will be responsible for the following activities : (i) planning project activities on
an annual basis; (ii) monitoring project implementation progress against the annual work
plan  and  evaluating  the  project  outcomes  and  impact;  (iii)  knowledge  sharing  and
communication  about  project  activities  and  results,  and  the  knowledge  will  be  shared
both  nationally  and  internationally;  (iv)  financial  management  of  project  accounts
including organization of the external audit on an annual basis.

18.
In each project state, a state level PMU housed in the ICAR of the state , will be
formed  for  managing  implementation  and  will  be  supported  by  a  committee  comprising
KVKs,  NGOs,  Farmers'  Organizations  and  IFAD  financed  projects.    The  State  level  PMU
will be responsible to implement the project activities under component 1.

19.
With  regard  to  Component  2,  Zonal  Technology  Management  Units  of  ICAR  will
draw  on  their  business  development  skills  and  will  work  closely  with  the  ICAR  centres,
originators  of  the  technological  innovations,  and  the  manufacturers  interested  in  the
license of the technology.
20.
A  steering  committee  will  be  established  for  the  project  chaired  by  Secretary,
Department  of  Agricultural  Research  and  Education,  and  with  the  participation  of  senior
representatives  of  the  Department  of  Agriculture  Cooperation  and  Farmers  Welfare,  the
Ministry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy,  Ministry  of  Food  Processing  and  Industries,  ,
Ministry  of  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium  Enterprises,  NABARD  and SFAC.  Representative
from Business Houses or Conglomerates such as FICCI, ASSOCHAM, as well as Farmers'
Organizations  etc  will  be  invited  to  participate  as  a  Special  invitee  on  the  Steering
Committee to ensure producers' and private sector perspectives are fully presented. The
Agricultural Engineering Division of ICAR will act as secretary to the Steering Committee.
The Steering Committee will review the project progress and facilitate interdepartmental
collaboration  at  national  and  state  level,  convergence  among  Government  schemes
promoting farm mechanization and access to renewable energy, as well as bank financing
to the entrepreneurs and Farmers' Organizations.

L. Monitoring and Evaluation indicators, KM and Learning

21.
The  project  M&E  system  will  report  on inputs,  outputs,  processes  and  outcomes.
The  result  framework  will  be  aligned  with  the  core  indicators  used  to  monitor  doubling
farmers'  incomes  in  real  terms.  within  this  framework,  farm  mechanization  is  assessed
through  energy  consumption/  ha,  level  of mechanization  of  various  agricultural
operations,  labour  productivity,  and  reduction  on  crop  losses  (given  focus  on
disseminating  technologies  for  post-harvest  handling/  storage/processing).  Additionally
an  Evaluation  Plan  will  be  developed  at  design  outlining  the  key  policy  and  technical
issues  the  evaluation  would  focus  on,  the  evaluation  methodology    and  the  sampling
strategy for baseline and subsequent surveys.

22.
Knowledge  management  and  learning  will  be  facilitated  by  reporting  on  tested
technologies and their benefits/limitations, adoption among farmers  and performance of
the small and medium manufacturers. Knowledge sharing will be organized at the level of
producers  through  agricultural  extension  and  exposure  visits;  at  the  level  of  scientists
and entrepreneurs for cross-learning and further innovation. The project will also support

transfer of technology to the global south as well as adaptation of successful technologies
tested elsewhere to the Indian context.

M. Risks

There  are  two  main  risks  :  (i) reduced  scope  for  renewable  energy  based
23.
technologies  with  fast  paced  electrification  ;  (ii)  increased  cost  of  supervision  for  an  8
state project for IFAD.

Towards mitigating the two risks the following actions are proposed:Whereas the
Government  of  India is  undertaking  electrification  at  a  fast  pace,  the  country  is
also promoting use of new and renewable energy resources. Hence, it is likely that
the  demand  for  renewable  energy  based  technology  may  not  go  down
significantly.  Nevertheless,  the  project  is  focussing  on  hybrid  technologies  that
can be used through both renewable and conventional energy sources.

IFAD  will  work  with  ICAR  to  set  up  the  necessary  procedures  and  systems  to
supervise  the  project  and  review  its  performance  in  a  comprehensive  manner. It
will help set up a strong MIS for robust data collection and monitoring as well as
use  of  technological  platforms  for  interfacing  with  project  teams  in  the  different
states    such  as  skype,  VC  etc.  Additionally,  review  missions  will  be  done  using
local teams where possible and field visits will be undertaken on rotation basis in
select states based on analysis of MIS data and field reports..

N. Timing

The project is proposed for a period of 5 years. The design of the project would be
24.
undertaken  in  the  third  quarter  of  2018  and  would  be  scheduled  for  EB  presentation  in
April 2019 .

rural  and  agricultural  sectors,  WB  will  focus  on  the
following  investment  areas  : promoting  more  resource
efficient,  inclusive  and  diversified  growth  in  the  rural
sector;  increasing  access  to  sustainable  energy,  and
improving disaster  risk  reduction.  WB  will  also  look  at
improving the business environment and firm capabilities,
financial  inclusion,  access  to  quality  and  market  relevant
skill development and more jobs for women. On the social
front,  support  is  planned  to  improve  the  coverage  and
coordination of social protection systems.

WB  is  currently  proposing  two  sets  of  investments  :  1)
rural transformation type projects that have a large focus
on  enterprise  development,  job  creation  and  inclusive
growth  through  the  development  of  commodity  clusters,
along  economic/industrial  corridors  and  support
is
provided across the enterprise and business spectrum; 2)
agriculture  competitiveness  projects
focus  on
improvement of resource use, innovative technologies for
climate  resilient  agriculture,  diversification  of  advisory
and other services to producers, organization of producers
and  market  linkages.  Both  types  of  projects  have  strong
focus on developing clear pathways out of poverty.

Key file 5 – Lessons learned

Lessons learned from project implementation and portfolio management in India

This section summarizes the key lessons learned from the implementation of RB-COSOP
2010-2017.

The CPE found that the traditional IFAD intervention paradigm is well established for
highly disadvantaged areas and marginalized groups and the women within these groups.
The paradigm rests on integrated interventions addressing social capital, agricultural
development and natural resources management, off-farm livelihoods, financial inclusion
and selected social services such as potable water, road connectivity, electrification of
homes and villages, primary health services. Recent projects include activities to
facilitate access to markets and partnerships with the private sector (CAIM, ILSP). The
CPE noted that as households and communities welfare improves, their needs evolve
thus requiring more specialized approaches notably in agriculture. This is particularly
relevant to the new challenge of developing farmers' adaptive capacities to climate
change especially in rainfed areas and ensuring profitability of agriculture despite the
erratic climate and the small landholdings (less than 2 ha).

Building resilience through the promotion of sustainable intensification of
agriculture and integration with livestock and trees. Where the agro-ecosystem is
fragile and prone to soil and water erosion or rich in biodiversity, the projects promoted
integrated natural resources management and conservation areas, through community
management. A landholding of 1 ha and less can be optimized through life-saving
irrigation, wadi horticulture with a combination of perennial and seasonal crops,
integrated paddy and fishery. Secondary activities in terms of income are goat
husbandry, backyard poultry and dryland crops.  The portfolio has promoted a number of
innovations in low external input sustainable agriculture, the application of integrated
pest management and integrated nutrient management, community produced seed,
alternative feed such as azolla. Adapting an ecosystem approach as much as possible to
project design will ensure that environmental problems and solutions are seen in a
broader perspective and that the suggested activities address all segments of the
community.

Access to land. IFAD had a few very positive outcomes with regards to access to land
that can be up scaled and adapted to specific contexts. In Odisha, OTELP collaborated
with Government Agency and Department, viz. Integrated Tribal Development Agency
(ITDA) under SCST Development Department and Revenue Department at the district
level to secure land titling to Scheduled Tribes to improve access to secured land. The
partnership with specialised services provider, the promotion of Community Resource
Persons (CRP) from within the communities and  capacity building are key features of
successful outcomes with regards to sustainable access to land for landless, women,
tribal communities etc.

Access to market. IFAD is building a nascent capacity in market access with recent
interventions such as NERCORMP, CAIM and ILSP from different angles. ILSP federations
has engaged in processing and packaging of spices, combined value chains development,
access to market infrastructures and to productive inputs etc.. CAIM has also promoted
partnership with private sector through contract farming. NERCOMRP has increased trade
of commodities by project households via better road access, construction of
collection/aggregation centres and market sheds. In some cased Natural Resources
Management Groups (NaRMG) and SHG associations have taken up aggregation and
marketing activities for various commodities. The Project has established linkages with e-
marketing websites IndiaMart (www.indiamart.com) to provide market access to
producers of spices, fruits, certain value added products and crafts based products.

These initiatives will be expanded and broadened in response to greater than before from
partners and to align to GoI policy and vision.

Participatory approach: In line with the participatory approach, the active projects
have promoted grassroots organizations as well as higher tier member based
organizations such as the federations of Self-Help Groups (SHG), of Natural Resources
Management Groups and of Farmers' and Fisherfolk organizations. The most sustainable
of these higher tier organizations are the federations of SHGs. The Tejaswini Rural
Women Empowerment Programme in Maharashtra has developed a model approach for
building such organizations. The federations' main sources of income are service charges,
membership fees and bank commissions. By project completion this year, 70% of the
federations would cover 100% of their costs.  Such a model needs to be adapted to the
producers' groups (whether farmers or fisherfolk with a suitable business model).

Focus on last mile delivery: Significant effort goes into building last mile delivery
channels. This usually entails selecting and training community resource persons to
support SHGs, farmers, livestock producers in exchange of a service fee; organizing
producers into groups to aggregate the supply of inputs and the marketing of produce;
relying on NGOs to carry out the initial social mobilization and provide technical
backstopping to the producers' organizations and resource persons. Once this structure is
in place, producers' access to services is greatly facilitated and the government programs
find an effective conduit for delivering their services.

The COSOP anticipated that IFAD would support IT innovations for better gathering and
sharing of knowledge.  Great use of IT was made to develop the MIS for SHG and for the
M&E systems of the projects. Phone and tablet applications have remained somewhat
limited. As the Government strives to realize transformational change over a limited span
of time, there are greater expectations that the judicious use of   IT and communication
can positively influence behavioural change at a large scale . As India is a great innovator
in the area of IT and many agricultural and rural applications are being developed, such
IT technologies are being retrofitted into on-going projects when applicable and included
as a key element in future projects.

Grants. The Programmes has financed several grant meant to (i) promote innovative,
pro-poor approaches and technologies with the potential to be scaled up for greater
impact; (ii) strengthen partners’ institutional and policy capacities; (iii) enhance
advocacy and policy engagement; and (iv) generate and share knowledge for
development impact. In order to enhance the benefits of the grants on the programme of
loans, frequent consultations will be conducted in order to address the specific needs of
the projects as well as closer communications during grant implementation combined
with a rigorous monitoring.

Gender and women empowerment: With women constituting 89% of the beneficiaries
of the country programme, this reflects the successful strategy in enhancing women’s
social and economic status, building their livelihood skills, enhancing participation in
decision making, ensuring improved access to and control over financial and natural
resources and reducing drudgery. Experience shows that the main determining factors in
women's empowerment are : the social mobilization; the use of SHG as entry points to
general awareness, social capital and financial inclusion; complementary activities to
boost women's labour productivity through reduction of drudgery; promoting home based
activities that enhance women's incomes in the initial stage; converging with the main
Government initiatives to reduce inequalities and violence against women; negotiating
women's participation in project related decision-making bodies. The micro-livelihood
plans at the level of the SHG federations have triggered the development of small
enterprises in the communities at a commercial scale. Moreover, several women leaders
of SHGs built up enough confidence and credibility to contest local elections and are now
presiding the Gram Panchayat.

Tribal communities: Tribal communities traditionally isolated from the mainstream can
effectively plan and implement programmes for their own development provided (i) there
is adequate investment in facilitation and capacity development; (ii) the planning,
implementation and reporting systems are transparent; (iii) mechanisms are set up for
social audit, and (iv) decision making is decentralised. Such project methodologies can
capacitate tribal communities, enhance their self-confidence and be most empowering. A
tribal development project with strategies having elements of decentralization,
participation, equity and empowerment, community-based approaches and transparency
in planning and implementation can succeed even in areas acutely affected by left wing
extremism.

Managing lessons and learning: The M&E system of the country programme should be
strengthened to align project and country programme results' frameworks, and to
provide information to the State Government and where applicable to national
government on project/ programme performance. In particular, the monitoring of the
productivity and business dimensions of smallholder farming needs to become more
systematic. The project M&E systems are still output and activity based and this despite
the information available from the annual outcome surveys. The outcome and impact
reporting will require the development of appropriate methods and systems and higher
attention to the timely implementation of baseline and endline surveys. Given the
existence of advanced tools and applications for monitoring, the country programme
should now make more regular use of off-the-shelf MIS solutions that can be customized
and adopted across the country programme, link the field operations to the state
management units, and systematically map the interventions (geotagging and geospatial
analysis).

Duration :The portfolio is characterized by a long implementation period. This is
principally due to the fact that given the reliance on community led processes of social
and economic empowerment and the coverage of multiple dimensions of poverty, the
projects are by nature process intensive and require a long implementation period (7
years and more) to develop strong grassroots organizations that can sustain the benefits
of the project. Experience shows that in such long projects, there are inevitable changes
in leadership, personnel and partners and this usually leads to a loss of institutional
memory with respect to the core features of the project as well as data unless strong
systems are put in place from the very beginning and mechanisms (such as training of
new incumbents) are embedded in the implementation for smooth transition
management. For this reason, it may be more appropriate to consider shorter duration
projects with a modular approach , coupled with a strong emphasis on MIS, M&E and
transition management. Experience shows that a degree of organization at community
level is required to effectively organize service delivery and that IT and communication
can be used as complementary approaches but not as sole delivery mechanisms.

Efficiency: The CPE rated the efficiency of the programme as moderately unsatisfactory
due principally to the implementation delays and high staff turn-over. Experience shows
that the projects need to adapt to the modus operandi of the state organizations and not
the other way round. This means that the project readiness should be more strongly built
into the design stage whereby the necessary clearances for additional staff and the
resources required are agreed to in writing with the concerned nodal agency and the
Finance Dept; the project director and core staff with the required profile are deputed/
appointed during the design phase; and the key procurement of implementing agencies
and baseline studies is well advanced at the time the project is presented to the IFAD
board for approval. In brief, this means compliance with the DEA readiness conditions.
The power of authority of the project director should also be agreed upon with the State
at design stage. An agreement should also be reached with the State and Central
Governments that in case of low achievement of AWPB and increasing disbursement lags,
