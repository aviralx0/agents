Bangladesh, a lower-middle-income country with a nominal GDP per capita of
US$2,022 in 2020, has recently embarked on a five-year preparatory phase for
graduation from Least Developed Country status. Between 2015 and 2020, the
nation's real GDP grew by an annual average of 5.2 per cent, reaching a high of
8.2 per cent in the 2019 fiscal year, just before the COVID-19 pandemic struck.
Several factors have been taken into consideration in the preparation of the country
strategic opportunities programme (COSOP), including the country’s desire to
graduate to middle-income country status in the medium term; the adverse
impacts of climate change and COVID-19; and the need for steady economic
growth in order to attain prosperity in the future. Rural poverty remains high, and
youth unemployment is one of the most critical challenges to be surmounted in
order to achieve the overarching goal of eliminating poverty.

This COSOP covers the period from 2023 through 2028. The completion review of
the previous COSOP (2012-2022) was conducted in 2022. The new
COSOP encompasses the 2022-2024 and 2025-2028 cycles of
IFAD’s performance-based allocation system. Based on current performance-based
allocation system scores, IFAD funding for the next two cycles is estimated at
US$240 million.

The COSOP is aligned with the country’s goal of eradicating poverty as set forth in
the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 and the Perspective Plan of Bangladesh
2021-2041. Efforts to realize that goal were operationalized under the Seventh
Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) and continued under the Eighth Five-Year Plan
(July 2020-June 2025) based on three main strategies: job creation and rapid
poverty reduction; inclusiveness in growth and prosperity; and resilience in the
face of natural disasters and climate change as a driver for sustainable
development. This alignment will ensure that IFAD lending and non-lending
operations continue to support the Government’s poverty reduction programme.

4.

The overall goal of the COSOP is to promote rural prosperity by generating
inclusive and resilient livelihood opportunities for smallholders, microentrepreneurs
and marginalized groups. The following two strategic objectives have been
validated in consultation with State and non-State stakeholders:

(i)  Strategic objective 1: To strengthen the climate change adaptation and
mitigation capacities of vulnerable rural communities through resilient
infrastructure and climate-smart agriculture.

(ii)  Strategic objective 2: To enhance the access of rural smallholders,

microentrepreneurs and marginalized groups to financing, technology and
markets so that they can diversify their economy and generate rural
employment.

5.

6.

The cross-cutting themes of the empowerment of women, youth and marginalized
groups, including ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities, will receive special
attention. Other thematic areas include innovation, improved nutrition, natural
resource management and climate change, and low-carbon technologies. The
target group includes the rural poor, marginal and smallholder farmers,
microentrepreneurs, and rural agricultural and non-agricultural producers.

IFAD will seek to collaborate with other development partners in delivering
complementary financial, technical and advisory services to leverage the Fund’s
resources with a view to reaching the desired scales of intervention and results.
These development partners include the Danish International Development Agency,
the Government of the Netherlands, multilateral agencies such as the Asian
Development Bank, the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations and the World Food Programme.

challenges and opportunities
Bangladesh is home to nearly 164 million people and is the most densely populated
country in the world (1,115.4 people per square km).1 The annual population
growth rate is 1.37 per cent. Bangladesh has a young population: 33.2 per cent of
its people are in the 15-34 age bracket. Over the next two decades, 52.4 million
young people will enter the workforce. The disability prevalence rate is 8.5 people
per 1,000 population (9.3 men/7.7 women).2

The country’s economy has been growing steadily for the past three decades, with
GDP per capita reaching US$2,022 in 2020. Bangladesh aspires to becoming a
middle-income country over the medium term by eradicating poverty. In
2015-2020,3 the country posted an average annual real GDP growth rate of
5.2 per cent, with a peak of 8.2 per cent in the 2019 fiscal year just before the
COVID-19 pandemic hit. GDP growth slowed to 3.5 per cent in the 2020 fiscal year
and is estimated to have amounted to 5 per cent in the 2021 fiscal year. The
economic structure has been shifting away from agriculture and towards industry
and services. In the 2019 fiscal year, primary, secondary and tertiary sectors
contributed 13.7 per cent, 35 per cent and 51.4 per cent to GDP, respectively.4

3.  Poverty reduction. In the 2018 fiscal year, 13 per cent of the population was

considered extremely poor and 20.5 per cent of households were below the poverty
line. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the situation in the fiscal years 2019,
2020 and 2021 to deteriorate across Bangladesh. Mass poverty persists, and the
number of poor people is high. Some of the most vulnerable areas are the haor
wetlands, the coastal deltas, riverine flood plains and the accretive landforms
known as chars, where millions of poor families live.

4.  Adverse impacts of COVID-195 and the war in Ukraine. With significant

declines in GDP (US$9.4 billion), exports (US$8 billion), investment (US$5.8 billion)
and tax revenues (US$2.35 billion),6 the macroeconomic situation has deteriorated
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has put a huge strain on an already
fragile national health-care system and had caused 28,000 deaths by the end of
2021. Another 19.5 per cent of the nation’s households had fallen below the
national poverty line by August 2021, joining the 20.5 per cent of households that
were already in that position. Temporary job losses in the private sector have been
especially marked in the case of low-skilled jobs in shops, the trades, restaurants
and the transport sector. Several studies have reported an increase in hunger in
both urban and rural areas: 9 out of 10 households experienced a negative income
shock to some extent during the lockdown, which may have resulted in a lower
food intake,7 and 12 per cent of extremely poor households were reported to be
suffering from hunger in June 2020. Food expenditure was reported to have

decreased by 28 per cent and 22 per cent in urban and rural areas, respectively.8
The Export Promotion Bureau estimates that the Russian Federation shipped a total
of $466.7 million in goods to Bangladesh in 2020 and 2021 (primarily wheat, edible
oils, fertilizers and chemicals, steel and aluminum). While the conflict in Ukraine
may have an effect on the cost of agricultural inputs globally, it is not expected to
have any immediate negative effects on the Bangladeshi economy.9

5.  Women. Although progress has been made, much remains to be done to improve
women's economic capabilities and opportunities. Bangladesh scored 0.537 on the
Gender Inequality Index10 in 2019. The participation of women in both the formal
and informal sectors of economic life has increased thanks to: (i) an improvement
in their access to education and financial services; and (ii) the increasing
availability of opportunities in rural areas, including in the agricultural sector, which
is encouraging rural women to take up informal jobs in order to contribute to their
family income. The problem of gender-based violence persists, particularly in the
context of poverty and malnutrition and in marginalized and disadvantaged
communities.11

6.  Youth employment. The youth unemployment rate is 79.6 per cent.12 The

2017 National Youth Policy is designed to provide special support to rural youth, but
there is no concrete plan for bringing that about. Many young people in Bangladesh
do not have the financial or technical skills they would need to develop diversified
enterprises; they also face geographical limitations. Only 1.8 per cent of the
country’s workforce has received formal skills training.13 However, 91 per cent of
the young adult population (both males and females in the 15-29 age group) is
literate and is thus in a position to benefit from vocational training.

7.

Ethnic minorities. Bangladesh has around 30 ethnic minorities, with the Santal,
Orao, Chakma, Marma, Garo, Khashia, Tripura, Monipuri and Rakhain peoples being
the largest groups. The Santal and Orao populations live in the north-western
Barind Tracts, while Chakma, Marma and Tripura peoples live in the southern part
of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Ethnic minorities' major source of income is
agriculture, although, thanks to improved educational and economic prospects,
coupled with a desire to integrate into the larger economy, they are gradually
moving into trades and other sectors.

8.  Nutrition. Although food security had improved before the pandemic struck, the

country has experienced some setbacks: 28 per cent of preschool children were
stunted as at 2019 (although other studies put the figure for stunting among
children under 5 years of age at 36 per cent14), 23 per cent were underweight,
around 10 per cent were classified as suffering from wasting,15 and 2.4 per cent of
children under 5 years of age were found to have micronutrient deficiencies and to
be at risk of malnutrition.16 More than half of all women in Bangladesh suffer from
chronic energy deficiency, and 36.7 per cent of women of reproductive age have
anaemia. The empowerment of women is a critical factor in improving access to

nutritious food, strengthening nutritional, health and hygiene education17 and
leading transitions towards nutrition-sensitive food production.18

9.  Agriculture. The primary sector still provides about 40 per cent of total

employment and remains a major source of income in rural areas. Bangladesh is
close to achieving rice self-sufficiency. Horticulture, livestock and fish production
are the most profitable and high-growth rural businesses. However, various
constraints are slowing down the transformation of the sector towards a more
diversified, resilient production system. Bangladesh also faces challenges in
meeting standards for food exports.19 Despite a broader rural economic
transformation process, the agricultural sector is still dominated by rice cultivation
and is driving much of the growth in productivity.20

10.  Rural finance. A sustainable rural economy depends on increased investment, and
accessible microfinance services play a contributing role in that regard. About
33.38 million people (91.8 per cent of whom are women)21 were clients of
microfinance institutions (MFIs) in 2020,22 and the size of the loans provided by
MFIs to finance the expansion of rural businesses is increasing. More than
50 per cent of the microenterprise loan portfolio is made up of loans larger than
100,000 taka or US$1,200. Seasonal agricultural loans are currently the most
significant loan product and are critical for the rural economy.

11.  International remittances. Remittances from abroad, which increased steadily
from US$16 billion in 2015 to approximately US$24 billion in 2020, are an
important source of income for many rural families and for the Government’s
macroeconomic management scheme. IFAD is currently providing a US$1 million
grant under the Rural Microenterprise Transformation Project (RMTP) to the Ministry
of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment for the development of a small
subproject for recipient households on the utilization of remittances for productive
activities.

12.  Rural infrastructure. Paved road connectivity in rural areas has improved, but

50 per cent of rural roads are still not paved. Investments in irrigation systems and
minor embankments are the main drivers for increases in agricultural production.
However, this kind of infrastructure is highly vulnerable to climate change and
poses maintenance challenges. Infrastructure upgrades such as climate-proofing,
solutions for increasing groundwater shortages and post-harvest infrastructure all
require investment.

13.  Environment and climate change. The geographic configuration of the country
makes it highly vulnerable to environmental and climate shocks. The Notre Dame
Global Adaptation Initiative23 classifies Bangladesh as being highly vulnerable to
climate change (157th out of 182 countries). Mean temperatures are expected to
rise and annual rainfall is expected to increase, thereby lengthening the monsoon
season, heightening the chances of flooding and altering cropping calendars. Rising
sea levels pose a threat to coastal areas in the form of the loss of land and,
importantly, salinization of groundwater. Furthermore, millions of people risk losing
their houses and farmland as a result of these impacts,24 which could eventually

give rise to a population of 13 million internal climate-change migrants by 2050.25
The combined effects of climate change could range from a loss from 1.3 per cent
(moderate climate change scenario) to 20 per cent (extreme scenario) of GDP per
year.

14.  Groundwater contamination and depletion are widespread problems which are
caused by agricultural production activities and industrialization. The growth of
small-scale industries such as leather manufacturing and intensive animal
husbandry has not been accompanied by enough investment in water, pollutant and
degradation management. Land degradation and biodiversity loss (aquaculture,
biome degradation, monocropping and loss of diversified seed varieties)26
undermine ecosystem services and productivity potential.

II.  Government policy and institutional framework
15.  The country strategic opportunities programme (COSOP) aligns with the country’s

long-, medium- and short-term development goals, strategies and targets as set
forth in the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, the Perspective Plan of Bangladesh
2021-2041 and the Eighth Five-Year Plan (July 2020-June 2025), respectively.

16.  Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. Developed in 2018,27 the Delta Plan addresses the
long-term challenges and opportunities surrounding one of the biggest deltas in the
world and sets out a vision for achieving a safe, climate-resilient and prosperous
delta by the end of the twenty-first century. It defines the following higher-level
goals: Goal 1: Eliminate extreme poverty by 2030; Goal 2: Achieve
upper-middle-income status by 2030; and Goal 3: Being a prosperous country
beyond 2041.

17.  Perspective Plan of Bangladesh 2021-2041.28 The central theme of this plan is
"Poverty will become a thing of the past". This transformation is to be brought
about by promoting rapid inclusive growth, building an innovative knowledge
economy and protecting the environment.

18.  Eighth Five-Year Plan (July 2020-June 2025).29 This implementation plan
carries forward the strategies of the last two five-year plans: promoting
labour-intensive, export-oriented manufacturing-led growth; promoting agricultural
diversification; promoting internet-based entrepreneurship; strengthening overseas
employment; constructing sustainable communications infrastructure; and
improving environmental protection and climate adaption.

19.  Food and Nutrition Security Policy (2020).30 This policy supports the

availability of safe and nutritious food for a healthy diet at an affordable price. It
seeks to increase access to nutrition-sensitive social protection and safety nets
across the life cycle and to foster capacity-building and partnerships for effective
policy implementation.

Bangladesh presented a national pathway document,31 which emphasizes the need
to adopt sustainable, inclusive and resilient climate-change pathways while
extending social protection for poor and vulnerable groups based on a life-cycle
approach.

21.  Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, 2009. This plan prioritizes

adaptation and disaster risk reduction in six strategic areas,32 including food
security and infrastructure. Widespread adaptation efforts based on the National
Solar Energy Roadmap for 2021-2041, the mainstreaming of climate-resilient
infrastructure engineering design policies and the creation of the Bangladesh
Climate Change Trust Fund are now under way. The country’s nationally determined
contribution (NDC)33 was updated in 2021. It sets out a pathway towards a
low-carbon development process and a climate-resilient economy and outlines
unconditional and conditional measures for reducing emissions by 2030 relative to
the business-as-usual scenario (6.7 per cent - 28 MtCO2eq and 15.1 per cent –
62 MtCO2eq). Adaptation measures focus on increasing food productivity and
sustaining growth in the face of the adverse impacts of climate change.

III.  IFAD engagement: lessons learned
22.  Lessons learned.34 The following lessons from 13 ongoing and completed projects

will influence the design and implementation of future projects:

(i)  Project design and implementation. Superior project performance is

strongly supported by simplicity of project design (i.e. limited activities, as in
the Coastal Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Project [CCRIP]), clarity around
coordination and last-mile service delivery (i.e. the Promoting Agricultural
Commercialization and Enterprises Project (PACE) and the National
Agricultural Technology Programme – Phase II [NATP2]) and strong
implementing agencies tasked with project activities that match their
strengths.

(ii)  Rural infrastructure. Appropriate rural infrastructure, such as market

connector roads, small embankments to protect farmland from saline water
and floodwaters, and irrigation works provide critical support for agricultural
livelihoods and for increased production, higher farm prices and higher
household incomes. This infrastructure needs to be associated with
investment in production support. As has been done in CCRIP and later in the
Promoting Resilience of the Vulnerable through Access to Infrastructure,
Improved Skills and Information (PROVATi3) Project, the integration of climate
resilience features into infrastructure design and construction enhances
sustainability and reduces the vulnerability of local communities.

(iii)  Access to finance. Access to finance remains of critical importance in

enabling the poor, smallholders and microentrepreneurs to create self- and
wage employment opportunities, as has been amply demonstrated by all the
microfinance projects that have been undertaken. The relatively high rates of
interest on MFI loans and other forms of financing35 pose critical challenges.

Systems Summit (2021).

34 IFAD priorities and the nature of these projects have evolved over time. Discussions on historical perspectives and the 2012-
2022 IFAD portfolio are detailed in the COSOP 2012-2022 completion review.
35 Since public savings mobilization is prohibited, Bangladeshi MFIs mainly rely on loans from commercial banks and the Palli
Karma-Sahayak Foundation and on beneficiaries’ savings. MFIs have expressed the hope that the larger MFIs could become
microfinance banks capable of accepting public savings. The Ministry of Finance and the Microcredit Regulatory Authority have
not yet introduced a microfinance banking law for the nation.

5

EB 2022/136/R.22

(iv)  Value chain development. When fundamental physical infrastructure is

already in place, the value chain approach to business development and
financial services has proven to be a successful model. Applications of
internet-based technologies will be critical for managing projects, value
chains, and agricultural and other microenterprises.

(v)  Policy engagement. Relatively small improvements in project- and

sector-level policies and practices have brought significant benefits for project
beneficiaries. More systematic analysis and research-based policy
development and advocacy will play an important role in engaging with the
Government of Bangladesh and bringing about more systemic changes.

(vi)  Poverty focus. The successful inclusion of a large majority of beneficiaries
from extremely poor and marginal small farming communities has been
effective in reducing poverty. An emphasis on climate-resilient livelihoods has
produced excellent results in extremely vulnerable project districts.

(vii)  Nutrition. Improved food safety, diversified home gardening support and
women’s empowerment can facilitate the adoption of more agroecological
practices and more nutritious and diversified diets (the Smallholder
Agricultural Competitiveness Project [SACP] and NATP2).

IV.  Country strategy

  Comparative advantage

23.  IFAD has the following comparative advantages: a track record of successfully
implementing projects in extremely vulnerable areas; critical insights and
experience in agriculture-centric infrastructure development, in financial services
for the poor, rural and other microenterprises, in agricultural ventures and
agribusinesses, and in practical climate adaptation activities such as flood
forecasting; effective partnerships with key ministries and implementing agencies;
partnerships with a large number of NGO-MFIs and with rural private sector
organizations; and the capacity to organize large numbers of informal groups of
women, men and youth to further social and economic development processes
under microfinance and value chain development programmes.

  Target group and targeting strategy

24.  IFAD’s core targeting strategy focuses on the poor, small and marginal farming

families, and microenterprises as direct beneficiaries. Rural financial services36 for
investing in improved livelihoods are delivered through NGO-MFIs to their clients.
For value chain development, the strategy involves organizing farm and/or
non-farm sector-specific37 poor beneficiaries and microenterprises in the relevant
functional categories, which include input suppliers, producers, traders, support
service providers and small-scale processors. Priority is given to women and youth
in specific farm and non-farm sectors, ethnic minorities, marginalized groups and
persons with disabilities.

25.  IFAD uses geographic targeting for climate-resilient infrastructure development,

land restoration and the promotion of climate-smart agriculture (CSA). It identifies
the poorest districts and subdistricts in the most vulnerable geographical areas that
have differentiated access to land (e.g. the haor, coastal and char regions). The
final selection of the type of infrastructure and project location is determined on the

36 These services mainly consist of credit for the very poor, the poor, marginal and small farmers, and microenterprises.
Microinsurance is an underserved and underdeveloped financial service.
37 Examples include high-value horticulture, pond fisheries, poultry and livestock, seeds and pulses, processed foods,
ecotourism, footwear and jewelry made of materials other than gold and silver. The production of footwear, leather goods and
jewelry is a major industry; thousands of microenterprises employ hundreds of thousands of young rural women and men in
small family enterprises and factories. Supporting these microenterprises is in line with IFAD’s promotion strategy, and IFAD,
working in conjunction with the Government of Bangladesh, has succeeded in improving the quality and productivity of these
businesses in selected clusters. According to the latest official data (2013 Economic Census), the country has more than 7.8
million enterprises, of which more than 99 per cent are SMEs and cottage industries.

basis of need and technical feasibility. Mechanisms to ensure that projects benefit
the poor, including interventions to secure lease and tenure rights, are explored.

  Overall goal and strategic objectives

26.  Overall goal. The overall goal is to promote rural prosperity by generating

inclusive and resilient livelihood opportunities for smallholders, microentrepreneurs
and marginalized groups. This goal will be achieved in the medium term through
graduation from Least Developed Country status and, in the longer term, by placing
the country on a sustainable growth pathway and adopting a food systems
approach.

27.  Strategic objective 1 (SO1): To strengthen the climate change adaptation

and mitigation capacities of vulnerable rural communities through resilient
infrastructure and CSA.

28.  To achieve SO1, CSA practices38 will be promoted, with various partners

contributing technical knowledge, inputs and services. The promotion of these
practices will be guided by IFAD’s previous experience with Adaptation for
Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP) projects. SO1 will support research and
development to bring actionable knowledge to local communities, including climate
information services. Community resilience will be promoted through
community-driven processes for planning and implementing agriculture-centric and
resilient infrastructure39 for inclusive rural employment, nutrition and food security
focusing on women and youth. The support will include productivity-focused assets
such as small-scale roads, market infrastructure, renewable energy and irrigation
systems, along with the broader “hard” investments needed to reduce climate
vulnerability, such as shelters and low-cost village protection systems. Investments
will be climate-proofed and coupled with soft investments in rural institutions and in
operation and maintenance mechanisms. Attention will be devoted to land tenure40
issues, as necessary. The evidence that is gathered will be used to strengthen
climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and will support the work
involved in implementing the country’s NDC and fulfilling other international
environmental commitments.

29.  Strategic objective 2 (SO2): To enhance the access of rural smallholders,

microentrepreneurs and marginalized groups to financing, technology and
markets so that they can diversify their economy and generate rural
employment.

30.  The achievement of SO2 will increase investment opportunities for smallholders and

microenterprises in high-value commercial agriculture and non-farm rural
businesses, including e-commerce ventures, catering to national and international
markets. Future investments will create more value by promoting local processing,
serving market niches (e.g. organic/ecological products),41 supporting the
production and use of safe and nutritious foods, integrating digital technologies for
improving food safety and traceability, participating in export markets via the
formal private sector and supporting the expansion of the rural non-farm
microenterprise sector. Women and youth in farm and non-farm sectors will benefit
from vocational training, and institution-building activities will strengthen such
organizations as informal producer groups’ business associations, multi-stakeholder
platforms, regulatory and certification/testing agencies, market information and

38 These practices include a wide range of activities, such as strengthening local organizations and institutions to field actions
involving, for example, sustainably managing forest and land resources under climate change conditions or sustainably
managing montane forest and land resources under climate change conditions. See the following FAO study for examples:
https://www.fao.org/3/cb5359en/cb5359en.pdf.
39 Climate resilience features will be incorporated into future infrastructure projects, as has been done in CCRIP and PROVATi.
40 IFAD has contributed to the settlement of poor people in a number of newly formed chars by facilitating the distribution of
land titles by the Government. It falls outside the scope of IFAD’s work to engage in any land tenure issues.
41 The excessive use of agrochemicals has been identified as one of the major environmental and health problems that need to
be addressed. Programmes and projects will employ an agroecological approach and value chain measures to tackle this
issue.

EB 2022/136/R.22

technology providers, and research and product development enterprises. Support
will also be provided for sector policies aimed at providing better access to different
services.

31.  Additional financial resources will be made available to enhance access to credit for

smallholders, other members of rural communities, and farm and non-farm
microenterprises. IFAD projects will work with apex financial institutions,
regulators, the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission, Bangladesh Bank
(the country’s central bank), MFIs, the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority and other
stakeholders to facilitate local resource mobilization mechanisms, including
crowdfunding, and the introduction of microinsurance; support the development of
an ecosystem for digital, mobile phone and other information and communications
technologies for development (ICT4D)-based financial services and strengthen
value-chain-related policies and practices. Households that receive remittances will
be encouraged to increase their savings by working with MFIs and building equity in
microenterprises.

32.  Theory of change. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate
change in the world owing both to its high rate of rural poverty and its exposure to
climate risks. The theory of change behind this COSOP is built on two pillars:
(i) improving rural communities’ adaptation and mitigation capacity;
and (ii) developing local economic and employment-generation opportunities, with
particular emphasis on women and youth, as a resilience-building strategy. More
effective climate change adaptation measures and increased productivity will lead
to more local employment and income opportunities, which will in turn help to
improve the population’s nutritional status, well-being and environmental
conditions.

33.  The COSOP will contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal

(SDG) 1 (end poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 5 (gender equality),
SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth)
and SDG 13 (climate action).

34.  Mainstreaming themes. The COSOP will continue supporting and strengthening

progress in the following areas:

(i)  Gender.42 The policy of placing priority on women’s participation in all

projects will be strengthened with a view to ensuring that women play a
leadership role in various forums, increasing the number of women business
owners and the level of self-employment and wage employment among
women, encouraging internet use among women and expanding their access
to non-financial services.

(ii)  Youth. Youth employment will be a high priority in the SO2 projects focusing
on professional skill development, job placement and self-employment as
means of supporting employment opportunities for the rural youth of
Bangladesh.

(iii)  Ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities. As agriculture and

agribusinesses are the main livelihoods for these groups, value chain projects
and financial services projects will continue to provide support for ethnic
minorities through specifically designed activities. Persons with disabilities will
be encouraged to participate in ongoing and future vocational training
activities and other projects suited to their abilities.

(iv)  Nutrition. All projects under the COSOP will support activities that promote
nutrition education, social and behavioral change, and communication about
good nutrition. These activities will target adolescent girls, women and

42 The percentage of women beneficiaries in IFAD-funded projects has historically been quite high: +70 per cent in
microfinance, +50 per cent in value chain development, +50 per cent in training and capacity-building, and +70 per cent in
labour contracting societies. The percentage of women in leadership positions in community-level groups is also significant.

8

EB 2022/136/R.22

children, in particular, and will be conducted in cooperation with other
organizations. The COSOP will concentrate on raising awareness about what
constitutes a nutritious diet and about the availability, accessibility and
affordability of a diversified diet composed of safe, nutritious foods. The focus
will also be on the promotion of safe foods and better health conditions for
poor and marginalized groups.

(v)  Natural resources and climate change. The COSOP will support the
Government’s action plan concerning the environment, climate change,
low-carbon technologies and renewable energy and will contribute to the
implementation of the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 and the country’s NDC.
Partnerships will be established with the relevant ministries, other
government agencies and NGOs to this end.

(vi)  Internet applications in management. Internet applications will be

supported across some projects as management tools, and smallholders and
microenterprises will be encouraged to make use of these applications in their
economic activities.

  Menu of IFAD interventions

35.  Achieving the strategic objectives. The strategic objectives will be achieved

through continued implementation of the Char Development and Settlement Project
IV-AF (CDSP IV-AF), SACP, PROVATi3, PACE and RMTP and through future projects
such as the recently designed Climate and Disaster Resilient Small-Scale Water
Resources Project (CDRSSWRP). The seven projects now under way represent a
total cost of US$1,025,740,000; IFAD’s contribution consists of US$432.94 million
in loans and US$20.34 million in grants.

36.  An additional IFAD loan of US$120 million will be available for the next three years

(2022-2024); US$41.4 million of those funds have already been committed in an
arrangement with the Asian Development Bank to cofinance CDRSSWRP. A similar
amount is expected to be made available for 2025-2028. Currently, the Danish
International Development Agency (DANIDA) is providing US$8.29 million in
cofinancing for RMTP. The Government of the Netherlands is currently providing
US$21.49 million in cofinancing for CDSP IV-AF and has committed an additional
US$17.8 million for CDRSSWRP.

37.  Country-level policy engagement. COSOP programmes and projects will

contribute to the policy and regulatory environment in two key areas: (i) climate
change adaptation, food safety, food system pathway transformation and
microentrepreneur networks; and (ii) access to financial, technology and market
services. The COSOP will support the development of policies based on the needs
arising from the implementation of those programmes and projects by
strengthening existing research and policy advocacy units or supporting the
development of such units in a limited number of institutions, such as the Palli
Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) (for financial services, business promotion and
environment/climate change issues), the Local Government Engineering
Department (for rural infrastructure, small irrigation works and physical
environment/climate change issues), the Bangladesh Water Development Board
and the Institute of Water and Flood Management (for water and flood
management issues). Additionally, strategic partnerships will be formed with the
Government of Denmark and the United Nations in the area of climate change.43
Strategic alliances will also be built with the Government of Denmark to address
food safety issues, with the Government of the Netherlands in the effort to combat
climate change, with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation to work

43 Examples of future policy engagement issues are: climate change adaptation and mitigation; expansion of safe food testing
facilities throughout the country; policies on e-commerce and the QR code payment system for microenterprises; crowdfunding;
the application of blockchain technology; and deployment of community-based flood forecasting.

9

EB 2022/136/R.22

on remittance-related issues and with the Japan International Cooperation Agency
to promote the development of export markets.

38.  Capacity-building. The COSOP will support capacity-building activities for project

target groups and direct beneficiaries,44 implementing agencies, relevant
government departments and ministries, regulatory agencies, research and
development organizations, academic institutions and relevant sectoral
associations. These capacity-building activities will take the form of training,
technical assistance, information, network-building, policy analysis, research and
support for pilot initiatives.

39.  Knowledge management. The COSOP projects will work with various institutions
(e.g. NGOs, research and academic institutions, United Nations agencies and
government organizations) to identify lessons and share knowledge. Each project
will incorporate an interactive knowledge-sharing system to increase technical
information preservation, usage and access. Progress reports and internal outcome
reports will be used as a basis for making management choices, while impact
studies will inform government policymakers and external stakeholders and will
serve as a source of insights about the projects' impacts on beneficiary groups.
Policy lobbying will be underpinned by research reports and policy papers.

40.  South-South and Triangular Cooperation. South-South and Triangular

Cooperation efforts will focus on generating knowledge, lessons learned and
capacities for addressing climate change; exchanging technology and best practices
to improve agricultural productivity; expanding rural smallholder producers’ access
to more formal markets; and creating new investment opportunities. The country
projects will be implemented in cooperation with IFAD hubs and other centres and
will be coordinated with regional knowledge management initiatives.

41.  Communication and visibility. Each project will have a robust strategy for

communicating with relevant stakeholders. The strategies will be supported by
appropriate documentation, such as policy papers, research papers, project reports
and success stories. Appropriate platforms, including social media, the press,
television and seminars will be used. IFAD’s communication team will support the
active dissemination of results and achievements.

V.  Innovations and scaling up for sustainable results
42.  Innovations. Building on past innovations,45 this COSOP will promote new ones in

such areas as the adaptation of ICT4D; promotion of commercial partnerships in
rural businesses; solutions for climate change adaptation using ASAP knowledge;
and project implementation.46 Currently, more than 46 per cent47 of the rural
population has access to fourth-generation internet service, and the country
programme will leverage this connectivity to offer digital financial services to rural
smallholder farmers.

43.  Scaling up. All current IFAD projects seek to replicate and scale up earlier

projects. Modifications such as broadening the scope of value chain interventions,
sectors and infrastructure, the use of information technologies to secure lands
rights for women and the poor, innovative integrated last-mile extension systems

44 Capacity-building interventions are included in specific project designs.
45 Past and ongoing IFAD projects in Bangladesh have developed innovative products (e.g. financial services) and project
implementation processes, introduced available technologies in new areas, and developed partnerships with research
institutions and private businesses.
46 This has mainly been done in the areas of financial services (e.g. blended and climate-proof finance) and value chain
development (e.g. labelling), payments for ecosystem service programmes linked with agricultural investments,
sustainability-linked debt (including loans and bonds with environmental conditions attached) and nature-linked insurance
schemes based on adaptation and greater resilience driven by improved environmental management.
47 According to the results of the Digital Literacy in Rural Bangladesh Survey conducted and published by the Bangladesh Rural
Advancement Committee (BRAC) in 2020, 46 per cent of the rural population has access to the internet. Most of this coverage
(which is thought to have expanded further since then) is attributable to the fourth-generation internet service provided by
mobile operators.

10

and the establishment of multi-purpose water user groups and cooperatives have
evolved over time to meet beneficiaries’ needs. The COSOP will continue to scale up
successful projects or project activities in the same or different parts of the country.

45.  IFAD finance. During the Twelfth Replenishment of IFAD’s Resources (IFAD12),

Bangladesh received an allocation of US$119.2 million, which includes
US$86.2 million under the performance-based allocation system (PBAS) and
US$33 million in Borrowed Resource Access Mechanism (BRAM) funds. During the
April 2022 Executive Board session, US$42.9 million in financing was approved
from this cycle, while the rest of the allocation is in the pipeline. It is foreseen that
the country will receive a similar allocation in the course of the IFAD13, bringing
the overall amount of financing covered by this COSOP to approximately
US$240 million.

46.  Loan conditions. Bangladesh is categorized as a lower-middle-income country and
is eligible for loans on blend terms. During the IFAD11, it transitioned to blend
terms under the PBAS and is now subject to a mix of highly concessional and blend
terms. According to the May 2020 Joint World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability
Analysis, Bangladesh remains at a low external risk and low overall risk of debt
distress, despite the economic shock caused by COVID-19. In addition to the PBAS,
Bangladesh is also entitled to access BRAM funds on ordinary terms. The applicable
interest rate on loans on ordinary terms bears a maturity premium differentiated by
income category and the average repayment maturity bucket. Bangladesh falls into
category 1.

47.  Cofinancing. In addition to US$327.15 million in ongoing projects, US$200 million
is expected as cofinancing from domestic sources, including the Government of
Bangladesh, during the period covered by this COSOP. In addition to
US$245.3 million for ongoing projects, US$400 million is expected as cofinancing
from international sources, including a US$128.80 million commitment for the new
CDRSSWRP project.

  Resources for non-lending activities

48.  DANIDA and the Government of the Netherlands are cofinancing the

RMTP (US$8.29 million) and CDSP IV-AF (US$21.49 million) projects. Ongoing
discussions indicate that both institutions are keenly interested in financing future
IFAD-led projects.

49.  IFAD will explore opportunities for securing access to funding for the design of
environmental and climate-related projects that could be cofinanced with such
institutions as the Global Environment Facility, the Green Climate Fund and the
Adaptation Fund. The following areas offer a strong potential for leveraging climate

11

EB 2022/136/R.22

cofinancing under the COSOP:48 (i) innovative climate-resilient production systems
in the dynamic char areas; (ii) adoption of multi-purpose nature-based solutions;
(iii) low-carbon pathways to better food systems; and (iv) building resilience into
infrastructure and strengthening ecosystems-based adaptation approaches.

  Key strategic partnerships and development coordination
50.  Key future IFAD partnerships in the country will be pursued along much the same

lines as ongoing partnerships:

(i)  Government. IFAD coordinates with the Government of Bangladesh at the

project design, implementation and completion stages and in connection with
COSOP design and reviews through the Economic Relations Division of the
Ministry of Finance. The following bodies are currently implementing projects
as counterparts: Ministry of Agriculture; Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock;
Ministry of Local Government and Cooperatives; Ministry of Water Resources;
Ministry of Disaster Management; and the Financial Institutions Division of the
Ministry of Finance. IFAD will partner with other ministries as needed for
future projects.

(ii)  Bilateral and multilateral agencies. Cofinancing projects provide

opportunities for highly successful, hands-on partnerships with the World
Bank, Asian Development Bank, Government of the Netherlands, DANIDA and
the United States Agency for International Development. IFAD representatives
will regularly attend the annual country consultations in order to share
information and views with all donors and the Government of Bangladesh.

(iii)  United Nations system. IFAD is a member of the United Nations Country

Team, and it participates in the formulation and implementation of the United
Nations Development Assistance Framework. Two agencies – the World Food
Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations –
are direct implementing partners in two projects. This type of collaboration
will be continued, and collaborative efforts to help the country move towards
the development of a pathway for food systems transformation will be
strengthened.

(iv)  NGOs and research organizations. IFAD will continue to engage in
partnerships with NGO-MFIs to deliver rural financial services, conduct
vocational training in haor and PROVATi3 project districts, and implement
social and economic development components under CDSP IV-AF. Academic
and research institutions will be engaged for research and development, policy
analysis and advocacy.

(v)  Private sector. With the exception of microenterprises working on various
value chain projects, there has not been a great deal of interaction with the
private sector. Partnerships with formal-sector businesses as buyers of
agricultural produce, processors and business service providers will gradually
be expanded. An effort will be made to engage with IFAD’s Private Sector
Financing Programme to provide financing directly to companies and to
financial intermediaries for the purpose of onlending, investing or offering
services to small farmers, the rural poor, microenterprises, and small and
medium-sized enterprises under SO2.

  Beneficiary engagement and transparency

51.  Beneficiary engagement. All projects will be designed and implemented in

consultation with beneficiaries. Inputs regarding the selection and implementation
of project activities, participatory monitoring and the settlement of grievances are
all examples of different types of engagement. Beneficiaries’ views are critical

48 See the Social, Environmental and Climate Assessment Procedures (SECAP) background study for details.

12

EB 2022/136/R.22

inputs for the selection of value chains, market research for value chain
development, partnerships with the private sector and training styles.

52.  Transparency. Transparency and accountability are key aspects of IFAD project

implementation and are exemplified by the transparent recruitment of human
resources and procurement of goods and services (IFAD’s and the Government’s
procurement rules are routinely followed) and by the practice of publishing project
results widely. IFAD projects are routinely audited by the Foreign Aided Project
Audit Directorate and external auditors (in the case of PKSF) and checked by
IFAD’s financial specialists during supervision missions.

  Programme management arrangements

53.  The COSOP for 2023-2028 will be managed under the direction of the IFAD Country

Office through the country director and will be supported by the subregional hub
based in India. This will facilitate ongoing interaction in the area of knowledge
management and the exchange of good practices between all subregional
operations.

54.  The management, implementation support and supervision of the country portfolio
will be the responsibility of the Fund’s country director and country team, in
collaboration with the Government of Bangladesh and strategic partners. The
country team is composed of the country director, two programme analysts, one
programme assistant and two junior programme officers. External consultants who
are specialists in different thematic areas work with the Country Office, which is
supported by the regional hub and regional technical specialists based in the hub.

  Monitoring and evaluation

55.  The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) work will encompass the monitoring of the

progress made towards the output and outcome indicators of the projects and
programmes that are being implemented, the COSOP’s midterm review and a final
evaluation at the end of the implementation period. All projects’ M&E systems will
use IFAD core and additional indicators, disaggregated by gender, age and target
group. IFAD will support the use by these M&E systems of information and
communications technology to improve information management and digital
reporting.

Transition scenarios

Bangladesh has recently embarked on a graduation process from the LDC category. This expected
transition to a developing country status will take place over an extended preparatory period of five
years (the standard period is of three years) and as such will largely coincide with the present COSOP
timeframe.    The  transition  scenarios  underpinning  this  COSOP  are  mainly  defined  based  on  the
country’s ability in maintaining its preferential access to export markets. The latter access tends to
be  constrained  as  graduation  implies  a  progressive  loss  of  LDC-specific  special  and  differential
treatments. Another key factor underpinning the transition is the ability of the country to regain the
pace  of the Pre-Pandemic economic growth  at around 7 percent.  Recurrent COVID-19 waves are
derailing economic momentum amid generally low vaccination rates. The post -Pandemic recovery
trajectory  will  largely  dependant  on  stepping  up  the  pace  of  vaccination  as  well  as  on  fostering
growth in key sectors, including the agricultural one. The latter sector which accounts for about 13.7
% of GDP will continue to employ about half of the workforce over the COSOP lifetime. While the
LDC graduation process comes with a series of challenges, its successful conclusion will confer to
the country a seal of global approval for development achievements and project positive signals to
domestic and foreign investors regarding the country’s business environment.

The 2021 RSPA score for Bangladesh stands at 3.8,
slightly above the APR average score of 3.6. IFAD’s
Rural sector performance assessment (RSPA)
measures the quality of countries’ policies and
institutions in the rural sector, for achieving rural
development and rural transformation benefitting the
poor. Bangladesh scored relatively high related to
clusters #1 and # 4 of the RSPA index respectively
covering the quality of policies and frameworks for
ARD and access to agricultural input and output
markets. The relatively low score on accountability,
transparency and corruption weighted down on the
overall RSPA score.
(5/6)
Based on the ND-GAIN index score of 36.5 (combining
a score of 0.543 on vulnerability and a score of 0.274
on readiness), The high vulnerability and low readiness
scores of Bangladesh place it in the upper-left
quadrant of the ND-GAIN Matrix. The country has both
a great need for investment and innovations to
improve readiness and a great urgency for action.
Bangladesh is the 26th most vulnerable country and
the 24th least ready country.

The country development trajectory could play out according to the following three alternative
scenarios, principally based on macroeconomic factors, including debt sustainability.

Base scenario: Following the 2020/2021 covid-induced deceleration, real GDP growth continues to
hover around an average of 5.7 percent over the COSOP period. Policy reforms continue to be put
in place, but domestic and external factors make it difficult to generate very rapid growth. Public
and  publicly  guaranteed  debt  as  a  share  of  GDP  continue  to  relatively  low  (the  updated  debt
sustainability  analysis  (DSA)  capturing  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  shocks  shows  that
Bangladesh remains at low risk of debt distress.

High scenario: In the best-case scenario, strong remittance inflows and preservation of the country
position in key export markets will accelerate the economy’s recovery. Vaccinating the population
will  reduce  economic  gaps  and  mortality.  Public  debt  will  remain  sustainable  over  the  long-term.
The country will manage to successfully graduate from the UN’s Least Developed Countries (LDC)
by the 2026 through a gradual transition to higher-value goods and services as well as by proactively
offsetting  any  loss  of  preferential trade  arrangements,  including  for  agricultural  products.    Under
this  scenario,  authorities  remain  committed  to  promoting  inclusive  growth  while  strengthening
financial  and  external  stability,  maintaining  fiscal  sustainability,  and  improving  governance.  The
projected  GDP  growth  rate  under  this  scenario  is  estimated  to  be  7%.  Furthermore,  addressing
Bangladesh’s vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters will enable the country's resilience
to future shocks. Shifting to green growth would ensure the long-term effectiveness of development
outcomes for future generations.

Low scenario: Under the low case scenario, a prolonged COVID-19 outbreak would delay and slow
down  the  recovery  of  exports  and  remittance  inflows.  Domestically,  a  larger  COVID-19  outbreak
could necessitate more stringent containment measures by authorities, causing disruption of supply
chains,  weakening  household  consumption,  and  delaying  the  implementation  of  development
projects further pushing the most vulnerable population towards poverty and food insecurity. In the
face of increased government borrowing, the already-weak banking sector may face new challenges
in  maintaining  asset  quality  and  providing  necessary  support  to  the  private  sector.  Under  this
scenario, economic growth will decelerate to an average annual rate of 5 percent, significantly below
the pre-COVID-19 growth performance. Debt service ratio are expected to pick up. However, public
debt  and  inflation  will  remain  firmly  under  control  owing  to  the  overall  sound  macroeconomic
fundamentals even under this low case scenario.

IFAD Implications on IFAD’s Country Programme
(a)  Lending terms and conditions

  Bangladesh is a lower middle-income country that is currently receiving loans on blended terms
in under the PBAS window. Blend terms come with a maturity period of twenty-five (25) years
including a grace period of five (5) years starting from the date of approval by the Executive
Board.  Given the projections of its per capita income growth, it is highly unlikely that the country
will transition to less concessional terms during the  present cosop period. Bangladesh is also
eligible for access to BRAM (Borrowed Resources Access Mechanism). Lending terms under BRAM
offered to Bangladesh are ordinary terms/Category 1 with maximum maturity period of thirty-
five  (35) years,  including  a grace  period  of maximum  ten (10)  years, subject to a maximum
average repayment maturity of twenty (20) years. These BARM terms offered to LICs and LMICS
are  subject  to  the  standard  maturity  premium  differentiation,  which  together  with  the  other
elements of the pricing structure, will ensure a minimum cost recovery of IFAD’s cost of funding
the  borrowed  resources.  In  all  presented  scenario,  debt  sustainability  remains  low  and  the
country’s creditworthiness will allow it to absorb all available IFAD resources (both under PBAS
as well as BRAM) if it wishes so.

(b)  COSOP priorities and products (e.g., investment projects, policy engagement, reimbursable

technical assistance)

It expected that COSOP priorities and associated products will remain highly relevant irrespective of
transition scenarios. However, given the slightly less concessional resources available under BRAM,
the  country  might  choose  to  forgo  them.  In  that  case,  the  overall  investment  envelope  will  be
significantly lower than the one available under the previous IFAD 11 lending cycle. This would entail
changes in the number and size of investment projects to be included in the pipeline over the COSOP
period.  Furthermore,  given  the  country  current  focus  on  charting  sector-based  pathways  for  a

5

Appendix II

EB 2022/136/R.22

smooth  LDC  graduation,  IFAD  will  need  to  be  more  proactive  in  policy  engagement  to  better
accompany   country’s efforts towards a more sustainable and inclusive rural transformation.
(c)  Co-Financing opportunities and partnerships

Due  to  higher  government  revenues,  domestic  co-financing  and  partnership  opportunities  should
increase  under  the  high  scenario.  The  low  case,  on  the  other  hand,  would  limit  co-financing
opportunities both domestically and internationally.

Agricultural and rural sector issues

1.  Agriculture:  Ecology  and  Soil.  Bangladesh  forms  the  largest  delta  in  the  world,  which  is  flat
throughout and stretches from near the foot-hills of the Himalayan Mountains in the north to the
Bay of Bengal in the south. The vast plain is washed by mighty rivers- the Meghna, the Padma,
the  Jamuna  and  the  Karnafuli  and  their  numerous  tributaries.  Onrush  of  rain  waters  in  the
summer causing overflows of the banks and flooding of low and outlying areas every year. The
land use  pattern of the country is influenced  by  agro  ecology, soil physiographic and climatic
factors.  The  total  land  area  has  been  classified  into  thirty  agro  ecological  zones  which  are
grouped into twenty major physiographic units. But broadly the country is flat with patches of
high-land  such  as  three  hill  districts  (Chittagong  Hill  Districts),  north  western  Barind  Tract,
Madhupur Tract, and low-lying haor (north eastern districts). The famous Sundarban mangrove
forest and forest in Chittagong are major forest areas which cover about 9% of the total land
area. Results of reconnaissance soil surveys conducted in the recent past have enabled scientists
to divide the country into 19 soil type units.

2.  Agricultural seasons. The country grows a variety of crops which are broadly classified, according
to seasons in which they are grown, into two groups: (a) Kharif (kharif-1: 16 March to 15 July,
and Kharif-2:16 July-15 November) are grown in the spring or summer season and harvested in
late  summer  or  in  early  winter;  and  (b)  Rabi  (16  November  to  15  March)  crops  are  sown  in
winter and harvested in the spring or early summer. Kharif are mainly rain fed and rabi crops
are irrigated. Rabi is the main production season for rice (60% of total production), vegetables,
lentils/pulses, and root crops production.

3.  Farm HHs. The Agricultural Survey 2019 reports the following key findings: a) the country has
35.53 million households of which 29.62 million (83.37%) and 5.91 million (16.63%) are in rural
and urban areas respectively; b) 16.56 million farm households 16.56 million, 4.02 million HHs
have no farm land, 6.76 million HH leased land for farming, and 9.09 million HHs mainly depend
agricultural labour as main source of income;   and c) 0.99 million HHs are designated as fisheries
HHs (fishers) whereas 1.61 million HHs have land for fisheries.
Land size is highly fragmented: 12.81 million are smallholders (less than 2.49 acres) whereas
10.28 million of smallholdings (80.24%) own less than 1.49 acres.

4.

5.  Major crops49. As reported by GoB agriculture sector survey the country has the following major
agricultural production: cereals (rice, wheat); pulses and oil seeds; spices and condiments; jute;
tea; year-round fruits and vegetables; and fisheries and livestock.

6.  Structural change in Bangladesh economy50. Agriculture sector contributes about 13.02 percent
(p)  FY  2019-20  to  the  country`s  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  and  employs  around  40.60
percent of total labour force (Source: Labor Force Survey 2016-17).51 An important change is
seen in the composition of GDP: Bangladesh economy’s structure has been constantly shifting
from  agriculture  to  industry  (including  manufacturing)  and  services.  In  FY2011,  agriculture,
industry and services were 19.9% 30.4% and 49.7% of GDP respectively. In FY2019, agriculture,
industry and service sector was 13.65%, 35%, and 51.35% respectively, that is, agriculture is
declining  as  percent  whereas  industry  and  services  are  on  the  rise.  The  trend  is  expected  to
continue where service and industry sectors will be the main sectors of the economy although
agriculture  still  employs  highest  number  of  labor.  Within  agriculture,  fisheries  and  livestock
subsectors  have  been  posting  growth  of  more  than  6%  and  3%  respectively.  Both  these
subsectors  are  enjoying  commercial  investments  led  by  small/micro  entrepreneurs.  Similar,
subsectors are also found in industry and services for example, manufacturing, agro-processing,
construction, hotel/restaurants, and transportation.  All these subsectors employ a large number
of semi-skilled and skilled human resources.

7.  Evolution of IFAD projects in Bangladesh. Historically, IFAD projects contributed to priorities of
the smallholders, poor and vulnerable communities and complimented GoB’s efforts for poverty
alleviation.    The  projects  of  1990s  and  early  2000s  were  implemented  by  GoB’s  main  line
agencies such as DAE and DoF under the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Fisheries and
mostly limited to extension services, training and demonstration of technologies/techniques to
enhance  agricultural  productivity.  Microcredit  was  managed  by  projects  which  was  found
unsustainable.  IFAD  in  the  following  decade  as  well  as  under  a  number  of  on-going  projects
moved to assist smallholders and the poor by developing rural infrastructure that contributed to
agriculture  as  well  as  overall  rural  economic  growth,  and  to  support  commercialization  of
agriculture by providing technologies, improving access to market and vastly expanding access

to  finance.  Value  chain  development  approach  for  farm  and  non-farm  sectors  have  been
successfully adopted. Due to its projects with PKSF, microfinance  has become sustainable for
IFAD’s projects. The rural infrastructure projects through LGED incorporated climate resilience
features  that  ensured  sustainability,  helped  transform  rural  areas  and  contributed  further
investment in agriculture and other sectors. With changes in demand and priorities of the poor
and smallholders and GoB, IFAD plans to complement Bangladesh’s march to prosperity.

8.  Agriculture: primary commodity production to processing. The economy and food security is still
dependent  of  agriculture:  about  40%  of  total  employment  is  in  agriculture;  Bangladesh  has
almost  achieved  rice  self-sufficiency;  horticulture,  livestock  and  fish  production  are  most
profitable rural businesses that have posted high growth; and Bangladesh is number 4 in pond
fish production in the world. With increasing demand from urban population these subsectors
are drawing more and more investments. Besides, deployment of new production and processing
technologies  are  improving  productivity  and  adding  additional  value  in  the  production  chain.
Agri-business  including  agri-processing  (food  products)  is  becoming  an  important  sector  for
investment and employment.

9.  But challenges are also manifolds: a) decline of cultivable land are at the rate of 0.5% per year
due to expansion homesteads and other physical development, loss due to natural hazards and
climate change; b) production and supply of safe foods is a major consumer concern; c) narrow
basket of commodities; and d) extension and other support services such as insurance, health
care  of  livestock  sector  are  still  weak.  These  challenges,  however,  provide  opportunities  for
future IFAD interventions.

10.  Constraints  in  agricultural  sector  to  raise  farm  income:  Aside  from  the  broad  challenges
mentioned  above,  enterprise  and  farm  level  issues  are  also  creating  bottlenecks:  a)  a  lot  of
improvements are needed in seed, farming, and irrigation to increase farm productivity; b) input
costs are high compared to farm price; c) access to finance is easy but cost of fund is high for
loans from MFIs, and access to commercial bank loans is limited for smallholders; c) quality of
farm produces needs improvement; d) high transportation cost as farms are often far from city
centers; e) limited climate resilient infrastructure in climate change vulnerable areas, f) limited
access  to  affordable  extension  and  business  services;  and  g)  access  to  market  including
international  market  and  market  information  is  limited;  and  f)  bad  weather  (drought  and
excessive rains) plays important roles during kharif season.

11.  Some of the above issues have been addressed in value chain projects (for example, IFAD funded
projects). Projects’ assistance come in various forms: developing capacities of producer groups
and value chain cluster & processing centres, gathering farmers and value chain actors, adapted
package  of  climate  smart  and  market  oriented  practices,  accessible  and  relevant  financial
services, technological training, introduction of high value commodities, improvement in seed
and  other  inputs,  access  to  market,  extension  service  and  uptake  of  relevant  technological
innovations (e.g. fish platform in NATP2). The value chain development of agricultural projects
are enhancing agricultural productivity, commercialization and diversification of agriculture, and
improving and expanding agricultural research system in the country.

12.  Agricultural marketing: Agricultural marketing in Bangladesh historically dominated by a huge
network  of  small  traders,  locally  known  as  bepari,  who  buy  either  from  rural  markets  (haat
bazaar) or directly from farm-gates, and sort, aggregate, do some rudimentary packaging and
transport them to large wholesale markets in cities or factories for processing. These beparis,
hundreds  of  thousands  of  them,  who  are  also  from  rural  areas,  perform  important  roles  of
providing  marketing  information  and  nature  of  demand,  and  sometimes  finance  farmers  on
behalf of large wholesalers (known as aratdar). The process has been made highly efficient due
to wide use of cellphones by small traders and producers. Normally cash payment is the main
mode of transaction. Large food processing companies also depend of small traders for supplying
commodities (e.g. spices, fruits, milk, fish) to them. Contract farming is not popular except in
case of tobacco because of one product and one buyer in case of tobacco, and some selected
hybrid seeds where seed companies buy back all seeds.

13.  Private sector in agriculture. Agricultural production in Bangladesh is fully privatized. Millions of
farmers, traders and retailers are the most important private entities. Gradually large private
companies  are  emerging  in  food  processing  sector who  are  buyers  for  farmers  and  sellers  of
processed  food  items,  mostly  spice,  cereal,  biscuits,  lentil/pulse,  oil,  daily  products,  small
amount of processed fish and meat. With urbanization and increase in income, the demand for
processed food is expected to gradually rise. For example, milk producers of PACE project supply
to large milk processors.

14.  Extension  services:  Public  and  private  sector  organizations.  The  most  prominent  agricultural
extension  departments  are  as  follows:  Department  of  Agricultural  Extension  (DAE)  for  cereal

8

Appendix III

EB 2022/136/R.22

(mainly rice) and other crops including horticulture; Department for Livestock Services (DLS)
provides  animal  husbandry  and  vet  services;  Department  of  Fisheries  (DOF)    enforces
regulations regarding open water fisheries and provides extension services of culture fisheries;
and  Bangladesh  Agricultural  Development  Corporation  (BADC)  is  currently  mainly  in  small
amount  of  seed  production.  BADC  used  to  supply  seed,  fertilizer  and  irrigation  but  all  such
activities are now almost privatized. But the influence and dominance of these institutions are
waning  fast  as  private  sector  as  well  as  NGOs  are  providing  more  effective  services  in  some
areas.  For  example,  seeds  and  extension  services  for  horticulture  is  by  and  large  privatized.
Promotion  and  extension  services  for  fisheries  are  mainly  by  fish  hatchery  owners,  large
successful farmers, feed sellers and NGO-managed projects. Similarly, vaccination services for
poultry sector is managed by farm owners or private individuals, but DLS is still dominating vet
services  of  large  animals.  Private  input  sellers  such  as  pesticide,  feed,  medicines,  fertilizer,
seeds, seedlings (plant nursery owners), fish/poultry hatchery  owners  are  major providers of
technical  information  and  will  be  more  so  in  future.  Successful  farmers  are  more  credible
regarding technical information to their neighbors than formal institutional providers. However,
such  private  led  extension  services  may  have  more  difficulties  to  service  poorest  and  most
remote rural households as well as to incorporate climate change, nutrition services or promote
more  agro-ecological  production  relying  on  locally  made  bio  inputs.  In  addition,  extension
embedded in sales of private inputs can also give rise to conflicts of interests and Bangladesh
face issues regarding quality of chemical inputs. Therefore, it is crucial to further work on the
role of public extension to facilitate more inclusive public-private partnership and to invest in
private extension for emerging green and nutrition sensitive production. For instance, PACE and
NATP2 have investing in local service and input providers that produce and sells bio-inputs and
nutrition  sensitive  crops.  NATP2  has  been  piloting  farmer  information  centres,  commodity
processing  centres  and  fish  platforms  which  can  facilitate  such  articulation  between  public
extension,  farmer  groups  and  private  extension  workers.  Government  could  also  invest  in
mechanisms to enhance quality assurance in such private extension for instance by promoting
certified providers, training of trainers, food safety.

15.  Academic  and  research  institutions.  Public  sector  agricultural  universities  and  technical
institutions are backbone of technical education (Bachelor, Master’s and Doctoral degrees) and
training. Similarly, public sector research agencies such as Bangladesh Rice Research Institution
(BRRI)  and  Bangladesh  Agricultural  Research  Institution  (BARI)  are  two  premier  public
institutions for research in respective areas. Besides, there are specialized agencies for spice,
horticulture,  jute,  sugarcane  and  soil  testing,  and  cotton  research.  Bangladesh  has  separate
livestock and fisheries research institutions that perform useful works in respective fields. But
research agenda is often determined by the institutions themselves where inputs from industry
is limited. Several projects such as NATP2 and PACE have partnered with such institutions to
improve  research-extension-value  chain  linkages  and  develop  participatory  research  meeting
smallholder needs and value chain to facilitate scaling of such innovations.

16.  Policy and regulatory issues: The laws and regulations are supportive of  the country’s private
sector investments in general. The government provides subsidy for fertilizer, diesel and bank
interest  farming  sector  to  support  agriculture  sector.  The  existing  regulations  also  support
environmental protection, protection of rivers, water bodies but enforcement of these regulations
is weak. Recently the government has established Bangladesh Food Safety Authority to ensure
supply  of  safe  foods  in  the  market.  But  this  new  institution  is  yet  to  be  fully  effective.  The
Bangladesh  Standards  and  Testing  Institution  (BSTI)  is  the  national  agency  for  testing  and
certification of selected processed food products.

17.  Micro-finance services. Microfinance institutions are the main source of agricultural finance. Of
the total disbursement in FY2019-20, 49.8% was for agricultural production followed by 26.68%
for  trading/shops,  4.11%  for  transport  and  communication,  3.33%  for  small  &  cottage
industries, 0.82% for social sector and 15.20% for others. The loans for trading also indirectly
support  agriculture  because  a  significant  part  of  these  loans  are  for  agri-commodity  trading.
Although  Bangladesh  microfinance  has  large  outreach  in  marginal  and  farming  families,  the
financial products need further customization.

18.  Commercial banks in agricultural finance52. In FY2020-21, six state-owned commercial banks,
2 specialized banks, 39 Bangladeshi private banks, and 8 foreign commercial banks disbursed
BDT 255.1 billion as agricultural and rural loans to 3.05 million borrowers.  Of these borrowers,
2.24  million  were  marginal  and  small  farmers  who  received  BDT  176.4  billion.  Several
commercial  banks  have  significant  NGO-MFI  linkage  program  where  MFIs  borrow  from
commercial banks to on-lend to marginal and small farmers. Under this program, in FY2020-21,

52 Agricultural and Rural Finance Policies and Programmes in FY2021-22. Bangladesh Bank (Central Bank).

9

Appendix III

EB 2022/136/R.22

commercial  banks  loaned  BDT  92.8  billion  to  1.61  million  women.    As  part  of  restoration  of
agricultural  sector  affected  by  COVID-19,  Bangladesh  Bank  launched  BDT  50  billion  fund  for
commercial banks and BDT 30 billion funds for NGO-MFIs that have been disbursed in FY2021-
22.  Private  commercial  banks  do  not  have  strong  rural  presence  and  do  not  find  small  loan
profitable. They are reaching the poor and farming communities through NGO-MFIs.

19.  Small, Micro and Cottage Enterprises: According to the SME Policy 2019 of the government, the
country  has  7.8  million  small  and  microenterprises  in  the  country  as  quoted  from  Economic
Census 2013 of Bangladesh Bureau  of Statistics (BBS), and the sector contributes to 25%  of
GDP. According to Economic Census 2013, the country has a total of 7.82 million enterprises of
which  7.806  million  are  SME  and  cottage  industries.  The  majority  are  cottage  industry  6.84
million  (87.52%),  which  are  family  owned  and  managed  enterprises  and  mostly  informal  in
nature.  Of  the  total  enterprises,  2.23  million  (28.5%)  are  in  urban  areas  and  5.589  million
(71.5%) are in rural areas. A total of 24.5 million persons (20.45 million men, i.e., 83.46%, and
4.05 million women, i.e., 16.53%) are employed of which 53.75% are by cottage industries and
82.97% are employed by SME and cottage industries together. This clearly shows the dominance
of  SME  and  cottage  industries  in  the  country.    Although  the  survey  is  10  years  old,  the
proportions  of  various  categories  of  industries  are  expected  to  remain  same.  If  a  6%  annual
growth  is  assumed  (same  as  average  GDP  growth  of  the  country  for  the  same  period),  the
estimated total number of enterprises will be 13.99 million of which SME and cottage industries
will be 11.62 million. According to Labor Force Survey 2018, about 85% of people are employed
by informal sector and 15% are employed by formal sector. Note that the microfinance sector
uses  a  different  definition53  of  microenterprises  (MEs)  to  suit  the  microcredit  program.  If
compared with the definition of the government, the MEs of microfinance will mostly fall under
the definition of cottage industries and the rest will be smaller than that.

20.  PKSF’s lending during COVID-19 pandemic. PKSF is an important refinance source for MFIs in
the country. IFAD has been partnering with PKSF for more than a decade that has allowed IFAD
to reach the smallholders with financial and non-financial services effectively as PKSF operates
as an apex agency with a large network of NGO-MFI partners. PKSF has been effective during
the pandemic by providing the smallholders their much-needed finance to continue and restore
production. In addition to its normal loan operations through 200 partner organizations, PKSF
has  received  BDT  5,000  million  from  the  government  as  additional  capital  for  microfinance
operations. PKSF disbursed the full amount to its selected Pos (128 Pos) by May 2021 under a
special program titled  Livelihood Restoration  Loan  Program (LRL). The Pos of PKSF disbursed
BDT  6,335  million  by  revolving  this  fund  to  0.184  million  poor  microentrepreneurs  with  an
average loan size of BDT 134,400. The GoB has also approved additional BDT 5,000 million to
PKSF to support poor people for the restoration of economic activities under a COVID-19 stimulus
package.

3.

Social, environmental and climate sustainability is critical for achieving the objectives of IFAD
and its partners. IFAD’s Social, Environment and Climate Assessment Procedures (SECAP)54
offer a framework and process for managing risks and impacts, and integrating mainstreaming
priorities on Environment and Climate, Gender, Nutrition and Youth55 into new IFAD-supported
investments.

This SECAP Background  Study provides context and orientation to the  Bangladesh Country
Strategic Opportunity Programme (COSOP) 2023-2028. It provides a synthesis of the current
situation, analyzes trends, risks and opportunities on thematic areas  that will orient IFAD’s
investments  in  Bangladesh.  Based  on  this,  it  provides  strategic  recommendations  for
consideration in the COSOP and identifies activities to be supported during the COSOP period.

This  Background  Study  was  carried  out  in  tandem  with  the  design  of  the  COSOP.  It  was
informed by i) desk review of relevant national policies and strategies, ii) consultations with
development partners, (iii) analysis of background sectoral studies on environment, social and
climate aspects, IFAD projects and country programme evaluations.

Part 1 – Situational analysis and main challenges

Socio-economic situation

5.

Bangladesh has seen decades of steady progress in economic growth and poverty
reduction,  up  to  2019.    From  being  the  world’s  seventh-lowest  ranked  country  in  Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in 1975, Bangladesh had decades of continuous economic
growth, leading it to achieve lower middle income country status in 2015. In its Vision 2041,
the  GoB  plans  to  achieve  the  status  of  Upper  Middle-Income  Country  by  2031  and  that  of
High-Income Country in 204156.

The incidence of poverty at the upper national poverty line declined from 48.9% in 2000 to
20.5% in 2018. Using the international poverty line of US$1.90/day, poverty declined from
34.2% in 2000 to 14.3% in 201657. These advances in poverty reduction are driven by various
government strategies, including the improved provision of basic services (electricity, drinking
water  and  sanitation,  education)58  in  order  to  reduce  fertility  and  infant  mortality,  improve
nutrition  and  life  expectancy.  Other  successful  strategies  include  the  wide  promotion  of
microfinance  programs  through  NGOs  (estimated  to  have  reduced  poverty  by  10%  in  two
decades59),  and  reduced  vulnerability  to  natural  hazards  as  evidenced  by  the  reduction  of
number of casualties by major cyclones.

Progress on poverty reduction did slow
down in the 2010s, primarily attributed to
a decline in job growth, with agricultural
employment contracting by 2% between
2010 and 2016. Regional disparities are
also visible, with east and central
Bangladesh achieving much more
progress than the west and the northwest
even experiencing increased poverty
rates (see figure 1). These regional
differences are attributed to the west
generally having a larger share of
households engaged in agriculture, lower
educational levels and different
demographics.

limits per Upazila, in 2016. Source: Bangladesh Bureau

COVID-19  had a severe effect on the
economy and appears to have caused
regression
a  strong
in  poverty
reduction,
though  post-lockdown
rebound  effects  are  visible.  The
pandemic induced a marked deterioration
in  the  overall  economic  trends  with
substantial  drop  in  GDP  growth  (3.5%  in
2020 compared to average 6.9% between
2010-2019). While there is no full picture on the impacts of the pandemic on poverty, initial
surveys  showed a strong regression resulting  in millions of  ‘new poor’.  A BRAC-PPRC study
estimated that an additional 19.5% of households were below the upper national poverty line
in August 2021 due to the pandemic, to join the 20.5% of households already below that line
before the pandemic60. Rebound effects were visible after the first lockdown was lifted in 2020,
but a second lockdown in 2021 had again significant effects (see figure 2). In the BRAC-PPRC
study, longer-term effects were most pronounced for the non-poor income category and for
informal workers. Across income groups, levels of private debt doubled. COVID-19 also caused
the  country’s  first  large-scale  urban  to  rural  migration  since  the  1960s:  28%  of  study
respondents  migrated  from  urban  slum  to  rural  areas  after  the  first  lockdown  and  10%
remained in the rural area by mid-2021.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused most of the agriculture producers, processors, traders
and transporters of the productive chains (perishable products of agriculture and livestock) to
have experienced income losses  due  to interruptions in supply and reduced demand. Rural

households  had  to  reduce  their  food  consumption,  mainly  in  those  households  where  the
woman is the head of household, with little education, young and with temporary labour61.

9.

Studies reported a rise in hunger and undernutrition both in urban and rural areas: a decrease
in  food  expenditure  by  28%  and  22%  in  urban  and  rural  areas  respectively62;  9  out  of  10
households  experienced  some  degree  of  negative  shock  on  incomes  during  the  lockdowns,
possibly resulting in lower food intakes63; and 12% of extreme poor households suffered from
hunger in June 2020. The government responded with direct assistance for the poor (cash and
rice distribution) and several financial ‘incentive packages’ for the private sector, agricultural
sector and microfinance sector.

10.  The agricultural sector’s relevance for the overall economy is limited and declining,
but  it  remains  a  critical  sector  for  the  rural  poor.  The  contribution  of  the  agricultural
sector to GDP stands at 13.7%, and the sector contributed less than half a percent to GDP
growth between 2015-2019. Still, with about 80% of the population living in rural areas, 41%
of the total population is active in the agricultural sector64. Moreover, 46% of rural households
in the poorest quintile derive labour income only from agriculture. Nearly all of Bangladesh’s
poverty reduction between 2010 and 2016 (90%) took place in rural areas. The largest share
of  public  expenditure  for  agriculture  goes  to  price  support,  income  subsidization  and  input
subsidies.  Approximately  65%  of  the  rural  population  is  landless  or  functionally  landless
(owning less than 0.2 hectares of land).

11.  Over the last two decades rural communities have gradually moved from subsistence farming
to  commercial  farming  and  non-farm  micro-enterprises.  Smallholders  are  adopting  new
agricultural  and  information  technologies  and  management  practices.  Financial  services,
mainly savings and credit, have dramatically improved due to microfinance although micro-
insurance service is yet to make any meaningful inroad.

12.  Strong  improvement  in  educational  outcomes  is  an  important  driver  of  household
poverty reduction. Bangladesh has made noteworthy gains in education, demonstrating the
fastest growth in the South Asia region. Secondary net enrollment rate increased from 50%

to 72% between 2000 and 2016, and access to tertiary education went from 1% to 16% over
the same  period. Bangladesh has  a 75%  literacy rate  in 2018 (76% for male and 70% for
female). Literacy rates are particularly high among the lower age quantiles of the population,
with 93% of people between 15-24 years being literate. High literacy rates strongly correlate
with high financial literacy rates and financial well-being.

13.  Bangladesh  is  making  good  progress  on  various  gender-related  indicators,  but
significant gaps remain. The country has reached gender parity in primary and secondary
education and maternal mortality has declined by 66% over the last decades. Participation of
women  in  economic  life  (formal  and  informal)  has  increased  for  different  reasons:
intentionally, due to the improvement of education and access to financial services (promoted
by NGOs and the Government), and unintentionally, as a result of the impacts negative effects
of  climate  change  on  agriculture,  which  pushes  rural  women  to  look  for  informal  jobs  to
contribute to the family economy.

14.  Despite  progress,  multiple  important  challenges  remain.  The  problem  of  gender-based
violence persists, even more so in a context of poverty and malnutrition. Rural Bangladesh
has an extremely high rate of sexual violence against women (49.7% of rural women reported
to  have  experienced  sexual  intimate  partner  violence),  with  nearly  30%  of  women  being
coerced into their first sexual intercourse66. There is a well documented association between
gender-based violence and household food security67. Women and girls tend to have limited
access and control over resources and finances. Their resulting dependency can put them at
increased  risk  of  sexual  assault  and  exploitation.  These  findings  demonstrate  the  need  for
programs and activities that contain transformative approaches of power inequality between
women and men68, while bearing in mind that  any intervention that seeks to change power
relations, may  also inadvertently create  risks for these  women which  needs to be carefully
analyzed and mitigated69.

15.  Microfinance is an area where the participation of women is very high. Only between 20% and
30%  of  women  actually  use  the  financing  themselves  (the  rest  pass  it  on  to  male  family
members)70,  although  women  claim  it  gives  them  a  new  status.  Beyond  the  access  to  and
control  over  microfinance,  the  accompanying  support  services  such  as  community
organization,  family  planning  and  disaster  management  are  strongly  associated  with
improvements  in  women empowerment.  Microfinance  in  that  sense,  has  been  a  vehicle  for
services  that  address  gender  norms  that  may  hinder  women  from  becoming  more
empowered71. Such effects were particularly seen in group-based lending schemes.

16.  Youth are experiencing the effects of slower job creation.  Young people between the
ages of 18 and 35 (GoB definition) make up more than 33 percent of the total population. The
percentage of people aged 15-29 who are not in education, employment or training is 30%,
of which 87% are female. This percentage has increased since 2010, primarily attributed to
the slowdown in job creation, particularly in the agriculture, ready-made garments and textile
sectors. Unemployment is higher in rural areas compared to urban areas. Unemployed youth
make up the large majority of total unemployment (79.6%).

17.  Rural youth migrate to cities in search of employment to help their parents who have lost their
crops and land (on the coasts and riverbanks) and to improve their quality of life. Young people
generally do not have the conditions (land, resources, and assets) to build up their own rural
enterprises. The majority of educated youth pursue jobs with the government, and about 20%

of all youth are interested in working overseas72. Every year, more than 400,000 workers leave
Bangladesh for overseas employment adding up to an estimated 10 million Bangladeshi now
overseas, but they are often faced with high fees for migration, lack of information on risks,
and exploitation and abuse while overseas73. Remittances from overseas migrant workers were
estimated  at  US$24  billion  in  2020  (7%  of  GDP).  COVID-19  has  caused  many  migrant
Bangladeshi workers to become jobless and face deportation from their host countries.

18.  A  study  carried  out  in  202174  provides  further  in-depth  insights  into  youth  employment
challenges, and recognizes the critical role of professional skills for employment. Only 1.7%
of the total working age population has participated in formal training outside of the general
school system. The vast majority of young employed persons join the labour market without
skills  and  take  a  long  time  to  learn,  while  formal  training  could  drastically  accelerate  the
process and also build new skillsets that respond to changing requirements in the economy.
Equally for people already employed, processes for formally recognizing skills and re-education
into new skillsets could enhance employability and labour conditions. Within the agricultural
sector, specific subsectors are most likely to be able to create demand for skilled labour. This
includes poultry and livestock, pond fisheries and horticulture. As production enterprises grow,
there will also be more demand for related skilled service providers, such trainers, vaccinators
and input sellers.

19.  Decent  work  and  harmful  child  labour.  Decent  work  -  productive  work  for  women  and
men in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity as defined by the ILO – is a
key topic of attention for Bangladesh. With the rapid rise of the ready-made garment industry
and associated challenges in providing safe and  equitable working conditions, the GoB and
development partners have been working to build protection systems and ensure the rights of
workers. The Decent Work Country Program 2022-2026 focuses on inclusiveness of the labour
market,  to  provide  opportunities  for  youth  and  marginal  groups.  Child labour  is  still  widely
present in Bangladesh, primarily as a necessity driven by household poverty. The COVID-19
crisis,  with  the  economic  effects  and  the  long-term  closing  of  schools,  has  increased  the
number  of  children  working  under  hazardous  conditions  in  industry  and  agriculture.  In
response  to  this,  the  GoB  has  stepped  up  its  efforts  broadening  the  types  of  work  to  be
considered harmful for children, and in early 2022 also ratified the Minimum Age convention
as final remaining ILO Fundamental Instrument75.

20.  Indigenous  people  and  ethnic  minorities.  Bangladesh  has  around  30  small  ethnic
minorities with Santal, Orao, Chakma, Marma, Garo, Khashia, Tripura, Monipuri, and Rakhain
being the main groups in terms of numbers. The Santal and Orao populations live in North-
western  districts  (Barind  Tracts)  and  Chakma,  Marma  and  Tripura  people  live  in  three  hill
districts  (Chittagong  Hill  Tracts).  Agriculture  is  the  main  source  of  livelihood  for  ethnic
minorities  who  are  gradually  entering  in  trade  and  other  service  sectors  because  their
livelihoods  are  being  affected  by  environmental  and  problems  and  climate  change  (climate
migration). The government recognizes that  the  ethnic communities of  Bangladesh  are  the
most  deprived  of  economic,  social,  cultural  and  political  rights,  mainly  due  to  their  ethnic
condition, having committed in the 8FYP actions in favor of their fundamental rights and social
security, together with the empowerment of their social, cultural and traditional identities.

21.  Marginalized groups and persons with disabilities. The GoB’s 8FYP identifies a number
of marginalized groups. These include the Dalit communities, also called “disappeared poor”,
who face a myriad of challenges including untouchability, social exclusion, lack of self-esteem
and dignity, forced eviction from the land, lack of access to support services and lack of access
to  government  services.  Social  boycotts  and  forced  labor  are  often  imposed  on  Dalits  as  a
means of controlling and exploiting their work.  Another marginalized group is those people
living  with  HIV/AIDS,  male  and  female  sex  workers  and  transgender,  who  suffer  social
exclusion and access to services. Persons with disabilities constitute another major group of

marginalized people (9% of the total population, including 3 million children); around a third
of all households is estimated to have a disabled member, which is though to be increasing
with the aging of the population. The prevalence of severe or acute disability is reported to be
1.51%. Disability is more prevalent in the rural area and primarily characterized by physical
disability  and  visual  disability.  People  with  disability  are  reported  to  have  less  access  to
education and income generating activities compared to people without disabilities. There is
also a gender disparity, with women  with  disabilities reporting lower rates of marriage and
higher rates of divorce compared to men with disabilities76.

22.  Food  and  nutrition  security.  Although  food  security  has  greatly  improved  due  to  the
reduction  in  poverty  prior  to  the  pandemic,  the  country  is  far  from  achieving  its  maternal,
infant and young child nutrition objectives. While there is still significant ground to cover, the
most recent pre-COVID-19 data on stunting and wasting showed continuous progress since
2004 with stunting estimated at 28% (UNICEF data, Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2019),
thereby being on track to reach the SDG 2030 target on stunting reduction77. The progress is
largely  attributed  to  the  provision  of  diversified  foods,  improved  sanitation  and  women’s
empowerment78. In terms of micronutrients, the severity of deficiencies has declined since the
1980s. However, a significant proportion of preschool-age children remains with deficiencies
in vitamin A (21 %), zinc (45 %) and vitamin D (40 %) and about one-third of these children
are anaemic79. There is furthermore a high prevalence of zinc deficiency among women, and
about half of pregnant and lactating women are anaemic as well. More than 50% of women
suffer from chronic energy deficiency.

23.  Reasons  for  malnutrition  in  rural  areas  of  Bangladesh  include  (i)  food  insecurity  and  (ii)
inadequate dietary practices.  At the same time, there has been a rapid increase in overweight
and  obesity  from  10.7  %  in  2004  to  25.1%  in  2014.  This  is  mostly  due  to  the  increased
consumption  of  trans-fats,  ultra-processed  foods  and  sugar  sweetened  beverages.  The
prevalence of underweight status remained high in rural areas, the prevalence of overweight
increased rapidly in both rural and urban areas80.

24.  While  Bangladesh  has  made  important  progress  in  terms  of  productivity  and  food  self-
sufficiency, including grains, vegetables and fish, there are still important steps to be taken to
improve food security. The Global Hunger Index evaluated the hunger situation to be serious
in 2019, and that 14.7% of the population is undernourished.

25.  Food safety and health. Food safety is a serious concern in Bangladesh, with inappropriate
use  of  pesticides  and  ripening  chemicals  being  some  of  the  main  problems  facing  the
agricultural sector, posing health risks for domestic consumers and preventing export. Studies
have reported a high prevalence of acute watery diarrhea, increase of enteric fever and acute
hepatitis,  and  a  high  incidence  of  disease-causing  microbes  in  street-vended  food81.
Inadequate handling of pesticides is leading to pesticide poisoning and a reported significant
number of deaths as a result, though there is no nationally representative data82. Introduction
of food safety standards such as GlobalGAP has been pursued over recent years, however this
effort  needs  to  be  integrated  into  a  wider  effort.  Beyond  regulatory  interventions,  market
demands for safe food do not reach the majority of smallholder farmers83.  FAO has set up the
Food Safety Network84 to improve food safety in Bangladesh, aimed at introducing improved

guidelines  and  training  of  farmers,  consumer  awareness,  inspection  and  enforcement.  In
terms of COVID-19 impact on food safety, some of the key risks identified include the lack of
cold  chains;  an  underdeveloped  food  processing  sector;  insufficient  availability  of  personal
protective equipment in food processing factories.

26.  Citizen  engagement,  social  accountability  and  grievance  redress  mechanisms.  The
GoB and major NGOs in Bangladesh have over the past year increasingly adopted new ways
of  better  engaging  citizen,  improving  social  accountability  and  providing  grievance  redress
mechanisms.  Most  ministries  and  projects  have  institution  and/or  project-level  grievance
redress mechanisms, often also replicated at lower levels. At the national, cross-governmental
level, the Cabinet Division of the GoB has set up the Platforms for Dialogue85 to facilitate these
processes and act as an overall grievance redress mechanism. Furthermore, the Bangladesh
Accord on Fire and Building Safety prompted by the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, has been
widely  recognized  to  have  instituted  an  accessible,  rights-based  and  confidential  complaint
mechanism86, which has inspired similar actions in other sectors.

Environment and climate context, trends and implications
27.  Bangladesh  is  predominantly  a
riverine,  deltaic  country,  with
around 80% of its surface classified
floodplains  and  having  an
as
extensive
jointly
coastal  area,
forming the Bangladesh Plain. Being
part of the world’s largest delta, the
country  has  been
formed  over
centuries  from  sediments  deposited
by  the  Ganges,  Brahmaputra  and
Meghna  (GMB)  river  system,  which
converge on the Bengal Basin. There
are only a few non-plain areas in the
country, notably the Chittagong Hills
in the southeast and the highlands in
the northwest. Bangladesh's alluvial
soils are highly fertile, but vulnerable
to  floods  as  well.  Flooding  is  highly
common
in
Bangladesh,  and  in  many  ways
society has adjusted to these natural
dynamics.  Nevertheless,  floods  still
present a major risk to human lives
and  economic  activity.  The  1998
flood  inundated  about  75%  of  the
country  including  Dhaka,  made  30
million  people  homeless  and  killed
over a thousand people. Other major
natural  hazards
in  Bangladesh
include
tornadoes,
equally  presenting  a  major  risk  to
human  lives  and  the  economy.  The
number of casualties resulting from natural hazards is however steadily decreasing.

28.  Bangladesh  faces  both  water  excesses  and  shortages.  During  the  annual  monsoon
period, the rivers of Bangladesh flow at some 140,000 m2/s, while during the dry period this
only amounts to 7,000 m2/s. More than 60 % of the net arable land, some 91,000 km², is
cultivated in the rainy season despite the possibility of severe flooding, and nearly 40 % of
the  land  is  cultivated  during  the  dry  winter  months.  Water  resources  management

interventions have therefore aimed at both providing flood protection and drainage during the
rainy  season,  and  irrigation  facilities  for  the  expansion  of  winter  cultivation.  Major  water
control  projects  have  been  implemented  by  the  government  to  provide  irrigation  and  flood
control. In addition, thousands of tube wells and electric pumps are used for local irrigation.

29.  Water  quality  is  a  particular  topic  of  attention.  Especially  tanneries  and  shoes  and  leather
production sites are known to have a risk of water pollution, which concentrated in industrial
belts and urban growth centers due  to inadequate regulation and compliance. Through the
emission  of  both  organic  and  inorganic  substances,  water  quality  and  ecosystem  quality  is
severely affected, while also negatively affecting the health of people working and living in the
vicinity.

30.  Forests and mangroves. Bangladesh has three categories of forests based on topographic
conditions:  (i)  hill  forests,  moist  tropical  evergreen  and  semi-evergreen  forests  comprising
more than half of the country’s total forest resources and carrying high ecological importance;
(ii) Plain Sal Forests, Tropical Moist Deciduous forests that have been reduced to only scattered
and degraded patches; and (iii) Littoral Mangrove Forests, of which the Sundarbans area is
the most prominent (see below). In the period of 2001 to 2020, Bangladesh lost a total of
197.000  ha  of  tree  cover  (10%  of  total),  which  equals  103  MT  CO2  emissions.  The
overwhelming  majority  of  tree  cover  loss  (93%)  was  in  the  Chittagong  region.  To  improve
forest protection and restoration, Bangladesh has amongst others set up a network of Social
Forestry projects that involves communities with a legally binding benefit sharing mechanism.
The region also features significant coastal afforestation programs.

31.  Fish resources. Fisheries resources, both brackish and freshwater, in the coastal areas are
remarkable. Bangladesh has the highest per capita consumption of fish-based animal protein
on the planet. The Jashore District is famous for breeding freshwater fish and catering to the
entire country with fish fingerlings. The introduction of aquaculture in coastal areas has had
serious  ecological  effects.  Vast  areas  previously  used  for  crop  agriculture  have  been
transformed  into  intentional,  perennially  waterlogged  landscapes  to  boost  shrimp  farming,
prompting new legislation to avoid further damage. At the same time, shrimp farming as a
major export commodity is equally found to be relevant for local food consumption and for
the enhancement of nutritional status, especially for poorer households87.

32.  Protected  areas.  Bangladesh  has  a  total  of  45  protected  areas,  including  sanctuaries,
national parks and community conservation areas. A review of the effectiveness of protected
area management showed that the regulatory framework is generally adequate, albeit with a
small number of loopholes. Enforcement of those rules is however found to be very weak due
to limited budgets, staff and a lack of planning. Human intrusion and disturbance is identified
as  the  main  threat  (24%)  identified  by  managers  of  those  protected  areas,  followed  by
biological  resource  use  (22%),  agriculture  and  aquaculture  (17%)  and  residential  /
commercial  development  (17%).  A  particularly  important  area  for  natural  resources  and
conservation is the Sundarbans area, a mangrove area of about 10.000 km2 spanning both
Bangladesh and India.  The whole Sundarbans area is intersected by an intricate network of
interconnecting waterways, of which the larger channels are often a mile or more in width.
The  Sundarbans  Reserve  Forest  (SRF),  the  wildlife  sanctuaries  and  the  ECA  are  managed
through  collaborative  management  or  co-management  –  a  shared  governance  system  that
involves the community as environmental stewards sharing the management responsibilities
with the BFD and DoE.

33.  Wildlife. Bangladesh was once home to a large number of species that have currently reduced
to  a  much  smaller  number  primarily  concentrated  in  the  Sundarbans  and  Chittagong  Hills.
Species include the Bengal Tiger, Asian Elephant, Gibbon and Asian Black Bear. Bangladesh is
a priority country of the Global Tiger Action Plan; therefore, the Sundarbans as the home of
Bengal  Tiger  attracts  added  global  attention.  Bangladesh’s  only  Marine  Protected  Area,  the
Swatch of No Ground (SoNG), is a continuum of the protected area network ecologically linked
to the Sundarbans.

34.  Current climate. Bangladesh falls under monsoon influenced tropical climate area with an
average annual rainfall of 2,700 mm, over 85% of which falls during June and October. Average
day time temperature varies between 23 to 27˚C, while the average night time temperature
ranges between 18 and 22˚C. While winters are generally dry and mild, summer months are
wet and moist, the relative humidity is generally over 85% during monsoon season. During
late April and  mid-November, the  sea  surface  temperature  often  rises  above a threshold of
about 27˚C, which creates an ideal climatic condition to form tropical low and depressions.
Sometimes,  such  tropical  weather  fronts  give  rise  to  the  formation  of  cyclones  and  super
cyclones.

35.  Natural  hazards.  Bangladesh  as  a  whole  is  highly  prone  to  natural  hazards  including
cyclones,  storm  surges,  floods,  landslides,  earthquakes,  tsunamis,  sea-level  rise  and
increasing saltwater intrusion.  On an average, one major cyclone hits Bangladesh in every
three  years.  It  is  believed  that  the  shallow  continental  shelf,  the  high  tidal  range  and  the
inverted funnel shape of the Bay play significant roles to ‘guide’ tropical cyclones towards the
low-lying  delta.  Most  of  the  casualties/fatalities  and  destruction  associated  with  cyclones
happen as a result of the accompanying water surge and high storm waves that sweep away
and drown people. The degree of destruction and the number of casualties/fatalities depend
on the time when a cyclone occurs, and on the topography and geomorphological conditions
of where it strikes. Although cyclone-related human deaths have been reduced significantly
due  to  improved  warnings  and  pre-hazard  preparedness  programmes,  cyclones  in  the  past
have  killed  many  coastal  Bangladeshis.  Furthermore,  lightning  strikes  cause  over  200  lives
every  year,  the  majority  of  whom  are  farmers,  and  the  frequency  of  lightning  strikes  is
reported to have increased due to increased temperatures, linked to climate change88.

36.  Climate  change  trends  and  predictions.  Temperatures  have  increased  by  about  0.3  –
0.5°C between 1960 and 2010 and is expected to increase by 1.4°C in the RCP 4.5 scenario
and by 2°C in the RCP 8.5 scenario by 205089. Although the total average rainfall does not
show any discernible change, the micro-structure of monsoon has been exhibiting important
changes. For example, the rainfall is exhibiting a bi-modal distribution over monsoon, the first
peak coming a lot earlier than expected (shifted from middle of July to early June). There are
increasing numbers of extreme rainfall episodes during the monsoon with prolonged rainless
days  in  between,  while  the  late-October  rain  (Kaitani)  has  almost  disappeared.  For  some
districts in particular, it has been observed that rainfall in the pre-monsoon and winter season
had a decreasing trend whereas it had an increasing trend during monsoon and post-monsoon
seasons90. Overall, mean annual rainfall is expected to rise by 74mm between 2040 and 2059.
However,  it  should  be  noted  that  trends  in  future  precipitation  in  Bangladesh  are  highly
uncertain.

37.  Climate change impacts. Bangladesh has a relatively high climate risk exposure, particularly
related to cyclones, river flooding and coastal inundation, but it has also developed significant
knowledge on climate change adaptation. Much of the country has some exposure to water-
related  climate  rusk  such  as  increasing  floods  and  increasing  intrusion  of  saline  seawater.
Subject to various climate change scenarios, sea level rise is expected to inundate 120,000
km2  by  2050;  14%  more  of  the  country  may  become  extremely  prone  to  floods  by  2030.
Coastal salinity problems will likely worsen as changing rain patterns reduce the amount of
dry season water supply from upstream river sources.

38.

Increasing  salinity  and  mean  temperatures  have  generally  negative  effects  on  agriculture.
Overall, crop production might be reduced by 30% by the end of the century; rice production
could fall by 8%, and wheat production by 32% by 2050. The increase in the number of very
hot days in Bangladesh under all RCP scenarios is likely to have significant production costs,
especially  when  combined  with  increased  frequencies  of  heat  wave  and  drought.  For  some
crops, such as Boro rice, the benefits of increased atmospheric CO2 emissions may offset yield
losses, for others, such as wheat, significant declines are expected91. When other drivers are
factored in there is strong evidence that net rice production is likely to decline significantly as
a  result  of  climate  change.  Winter  crop  production  would  be  seriously  hampered  due  to  a
warmer  and  drier  environment  during  non-monsoon  seasons,  while  moisture  stress  might
force  farmers  to  reduce  the  area  under  irrigated  rice  cultivation.  In  November  2019,  the
Bangladesh parliament unanimously declared climate change a ‘planetary emergency’, serving
as a call to action for other nations on the urgency of emission reduction as well.

39.  Climate change impacts are also seen in the public health domain. A one degree increase in
temperature  is  found  to  increase  the  likelihood  of  contracting  a  waterborne  disease  by  4.2
percentage points, and the likelihood  of contracting  a  respiratory illness by 5.7 percentage
points92.

40.  Climate  change  adaptation.  Notwithstanding  the  severe  impacts  of  climate  change  in
Bangladesh, there is also a long history of dealing with a changing, dynamic environment in
the country. The concrete impacts of climate change already caused a considerable amount of
autonomous adaptation amongst farmers across Bangladesh, involving changes to livelihood
assets and income generating activities93.  It has also prompted many climate change related
strategies and projects to be implemented across Bangladesh. In 2018, Bangladesh finalized
the  Bangladesh  Delta  Plan  2100,  which  provides  an  overarching  view  of  water-related
adaptation strategies (referenced in the next section).

Institutions and legal framework
Institutions, policies and regulatory frameworks
41.  Gender.  The  Constitution  of  Bangladesh  lays  down  the  general  principles  regarding  the
protection  of  women  from  all  forms  of  discrimination  and  the  promotion  of  their  equal
participation.  Bangladesh  ratified  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of
Discrimination  against  Women  (CEDAW)  in  1984.  The  GoB  adopted  a  National  Women
Development  Policy  in  2011  with  an  accompanying  Action  Plan  to  guide  implementation
thereof.  This  commits  the  government,  amongst  others,  to  operationalize  gender-sensitive

planning and budgeting, ensuring equal pay in all sectors, enhance women leadership in the
political  arena,  and  build  productive  capacity  of  women  more  generally.  Parliament  has  50
reserved seats for women (in addition to 300 general seats), and local governments have a
quota on the representation of women in councils.

42.  The Ministry of Women and Children Affairs is tasked with the empowerment of women and
children through a mainstreaming approach, combined with a variety of cross-governmental
structures  such  as  a  high-level  National  Council  for  Women  and  Children  Development,
comprising  ministers,  secretaries,  MPs  and  prominent  women.  Other  line  ministries  and
departments,  such  as  the  LGED,  have  adopted  their  own  gender  policies  and  action  plans
tailored to their sectors. Such cross-governmental structures also exist at local government
level, through the Women In Development Coordination Committees. The Ministry of Women
and Children’s Affairs that manages eight Comprehensive Crisis Centers at division levels to
provide information and services to victims of violence, however, there are very few reported
cases and much less those that have followed legal processes.

43.  Environment.  The  National  Environmental  Policy  (1992)  has  a  dual  objective  of  ensuring
protection  and  sustainable  management  of  the  environment.  It  identifies  and  regulates
activities that may degrade the environment and ensures the sustainable and environmentally
sound use of natural resources. The National Environmental Management Plan (1995)94 is a
broad set of programs aimed to implement this policy.  The Environmental Conservation Act
(1995)95 and accompanying Rules (1997)96 have a specific objective of setting the standards
and procedures to prevent pollution of the environment. It is therefore an important piece of
legislation  that  guides  the  execution  of  project  screening,  assessment  and  monitoring,  and
empowers the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change to exercise its role. It also
provides the legal basis for the protection of ecologically critical areas.

44.  The  National  Water  Policy  (1999)97  focuses  on  protection,  restoration  and  enhancement  of
water resources; protection of water quality; provision of sanitation and potable water; and
the participation of local communities in water development projects. The Bangladesh Delta
Plan 2100 (2018) defines the strategy to ensure long term water and food security, economic
growth and environmental sustainability while reducing vulnerability to natural disasters and
building resilience to climate change. At national level, the BDP2100 comprises the following
strategies: (i) protecting economic strongholds and critical infrastructure; (ii) equipping the
flood  management  and  drainage  schemes  for  the  future;  (iii)  safeguarding  livelihoods  of
vulnerable  communities;  (iv)  balancing  supply  and  demand  for  freshwater;  and  (v)
maintaining water quality. Region or hotspot-specific strategies are included in Table 1.

45.  Protected  areas  and  biodiversity.  The  National  Forest  Policy  (1979)  focuses  on  the
preservation and scientific management of forestlands, the designation of forests as national
forests, the organizational and research needs to protect the forests and the preservation of
wildlife. The updated Wildlife Act of 2012 provides the legal underpinning of the management
protected areas and sets several definitions on technical aspects such as buffer zones and lists
of  protected  species.  The  2nd  National  Biodiversity  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  of  Bangladesh
(2016  –  2021)98  is  a  guiding  framework  for  biodiversity  conservation,  ensuring  sustainable
use of natural resources and protecting the diversity of flora and fauna and habitats.

46.  Fisheries. The National Fisheries Policy (1998), Inland Capture Fisheries Strategy (2006) and
National Shrimp Policy (2014)99 guide the overall fisheries sector in the country were heavily
drawing from the open capture fisheries in the region. The Shrimp Policy in particular, seeks
to  avoid  the  damaging  environmental  impact  that  the  shrimp  industry  has  caused  in  other
countries,  by  limiting  the  size  of  shrimp  enclosures  and  by  requiring  clearance  from  the
Department of Environment to operate in mangrove areas.

47.  Climate.  The  Bangladesh  Climate  Change  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  (2009)100  prioritizes
adaptation and disaster risk reduction and has been complemented by programs and plans in
six strategic areas101, including food security and infrastructure. Widespread adaptation efforts
are now underway through for instance the  national solar energy roadmap 2021-2041, the
mainstreaming of climate resilient infrastructure engineering design policies, and the creation
of the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund. A National Adaptation Plan is currently being
developed, as a successor to the National Adaptation Programme of Action (2009)102.

48.  Bangladesh  submitted  its  initial  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  (NDC)  to  the  Paris
Agreement on September 21, 2016, followed by an interim NDC 2020 on December 31, 2020,
and  an  Updated  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  on  August  26,  2021103.  It  sets  out  its
commitment  towards  a  low-carbon  development  pathway  with  a  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)
emission target of 6.7% (28 Mt CO2eq) by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario,
going up to 15.1% (62 Mt CO2eq) reduction subject to financial, technical and capacity building
support from both national and international partners. In agriculture, the largest increase in
emissions is expected from agricultural energy use (see Table 2). The NDC includes relevant
mitigation  targets  in  agriculture  achieved  through  investments  in  solar  irrigation  pumps,
methane reduction from rice fields, mini biogas plants and low-emission dairy development.
At the adaptation level the key activities related to agriculture and food security foreseen are
focus mainly on increasing food productivity and sustaining growth in the face of the adverse
effect  of  climate  change.  The  GoB’s  3rd  communication  to  the  UNFCCC  further  highlights

49.  Youth. There are a range of government policies and programmes that explicitly target youth,
as well as a large number that have a strong effect on youth without explicitly targeting them.
The National Policy for Youth (2017) aims to ensure special support is provided to rural youth
with  opportunities  to  boost  the  rural  economy  (including  with  lease  of  government  owned
Khaas farmland, ponds and ‘Jolmohal). The National Education Policy is equally important for
youth.  Initiatives  are  now  underway  to  particularly  strengthen  tertiary  education  in  the
country. The Ministry  of  Youth and  Sports is the  responsible line  ministry to  address youth
issues.  The  government  also  established  the  Sheikh  Hasina  National  Youth  Development
Institute in 2017, tasked to conduct research, training and facilitating constructive activities.
Other  relevant  policies  include  the  National  Skills  Development  Policy  (2011),  which  puts
special emphasis on the training and learning of youth, women, low-skilled people and people
with disabilities.

50.  Decent  work  and  harmful  child  labour.  The  Decent  Work  agenda  is  a  shared  objective
across government, private sector and civil society. The Decent Work Country Program 2022-
2026  thereby  involves  the  GoB,  the  Bangladesh  Employers’  Federation,  the  National
Coordination Committee for Workers’ Education and the Industrial Bangladesh Council. In the
GoB, the Ministry of Labour and Employment is responsible for employment and to protect the
interests of workers. The same Ministry is also spearheading the National Child Labour Welfare
Council,  which  prepared  the  National  Plan  to  Eliminate  Child  Labour  (2020-2025)105  as  an
implementation  mechanism  to  the  National  Child  Labour  Elimination  Policy  (2010)106.  The
National Plan involves a broad range of line ministries, whereas international agencies such as
the ILO are providing support.

51.  Indigenous  peoples  and  ethnic  minorities.  The  government  does  not  recognize
indigenous peoples as “indigenous”, but instead identifies “tribes, minor races, sects and ethnic
communities” in Article 23A, and obliges the state to protect and develop their unique local
culture  and  traditions,  the  protection  against  all  forms  of  exploitation  (article  14),  the
prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth (article
28); and equal opportunities in public employment, while allowing the State to adopt special
provisions  to  guarantee  adequate  representation  of  these  sectors  of  the  population  (article
29).  Bangladesh  is  a  signatory  to  major  international  human  rights  instruments  that  are
directly or indirectly relevant to the rights of tribal/indigenous peoples, such as ILO Convention
107 on Tribal Populations.

52.  Persons  with  disabilities.  Bangladesh  has  ratified  the  UN  Convention  on  the  Rights  of
Persons  with  Disabilities  (in  2008).  The  country’s  Constitution  (1972)  guarantees  the  basic

human rights of every citizen and prohibits any form of discrimination between social groups,
including persons with disabilities. The Rights and Protection of Persons with Disabilities Act
(2013) provides for specific measures such as accessibility provision in public spaces and equal
opportunities in employment, while equally requiring persons with disabilities to register for
identity cards to be able to track their enrolment in educational institutions and their access
to jobs107. The  Ministry of Social Welfare  is responsible for advancing  the rights of persons
with  disabilities,  and  within  that  Ministry  the  National  Foundation  for  the  Development  of
Disabled  Persons  is  actively  providing  support,  including  through  Services  and  Assistance
Centres in all districts.

53.  Nutrition. The Food and Nutrition Security Policy (2020)108 is the primary policy for nutrition
and  builds  on  an  array  of  past  policies,  such  as  the  National  Food  Policy  (2006),  National
Nutrition Policy (2015), National Social Security Strategy (2015), and the National Agricultural
Policy  (2018).  This  new  policy  includes  the  following  strategic  objectives:  1)  to  ensure
availability  of  safe  and  nutritious  food  for  healthy  diets,  2)  to  ensure  access  to  safe  and
nutritious food at an affordable price, 3) to enhance the consumption and utilization of healthy
and diversified diets for achieving nutrition improvements, 4) to increase access to nutrition-
sensitive social protection and safety nets across life cycle with a focus on vulnerable groups
and  regions,  5)  to  strengthen  cross-sectoral  food  and  nutrition  security  governance,
coordination, capacity building and partnership for effective policy implementation. The new
policy  is,  in  contrast  to  its  predecessors,  designed  to  cut  across  the  mandates  of  a  dozen
ministries and apply a nutrition lens in various sectoral strategies.

Relevant programmes and partnerships
54.  Given the size of the country and the broad range of development challenges, the number of
relevant  programmes  and  partnerships  are  equally  vast.  This  section  therefore  merely
provides  a  selection  of  some  of  the  programmes  and  partnerships  that  are  deemed  most
relevant to the strategy as laid out in the COSOP 2023-2028, and the issues identified in this
SECAP Background Study.

55.  Extended Community Climate Change Project – Flood (ECCCP-Flood, 2019-2024)109.
This project, implemented  by PKSF and  financed  by  the Green Climate Fund, works on the
interface of community-driven investments in climate change adaptation and social protection
programmes.  One  of  the  specific  interventions  is  to  establish  Climate  Change  Adaptation
Groups at community level.

56.  Climate  Smart  Agriculture  and  Water  Management  Project  (2021  –  2026)110.  This
project,  funded  by  the  World  Bank  and  carried  out  by  the  Bangladesh  Water  Development
Board, Department of Agricultural Extension and Department of Fisheries shares similarities
with the current IFAD-funded portfolio and offers opportunities for cross-learning. It includes
climate smart agriculture research and extension and the development of an interactive voice
response system for citizen and community engagement, which could be relevant for the IFAD-
funded portfolio

57.

‘My Village, My Town’. This government-led initiative aims to reduce the gap between cities
and  rural  areas,  by  bringing  essential  facilities  such  as  improved  roads,  drinking  water,
healthcare  services  and  education  to  villages.  A  pilot  project  was  initiated  in  15  villages  in
2020. The project may provide relevant entry points and learnings for IFAD-supported projects
in terms of improving access to healthcare and in terms of educating youth and creating job
opportunities.

58.  Strengthening Women’s Ability for Productive New Opportunities (SWAPNO, 2014-
2022) programme111. SWAPNO was a gender based social security project targeting 65,000
ultra-poor  rural  women  who  are  widowed,  divorced,  abandoned,  or  left  with  a  disabled

husband. The project aims to uplift these women out of extreme poverty through productive
and sustainable livelihoods. Under the auspices of National Social Security Strategy (NSSS) of
Bangladesh government, SWAPNO was implemented jointly by Local Government Division and
UNDP.  SWAPNO’s  intervention  follows  a  graduation  model  that  encompasses  livelihood
promotion, financial inclusion, social  protection, and  social empowerment.  The women are
employed  for  a  specific  period  under  public  works.  Simultaneously,  training  is  provided  to
improve self-confidence, leadership, financial literacy, basic numeracy, savings, and spending.
This  process  is  followed  by  livelihood  training  based  on  their  interests  and  local  market
opportunities  to  begin  micro-enterprises  or  find  formal  employment.  After  completing  their
employment tenure, they can access funds to invest in their enterprises.

59.  Feed  the  Future  Bangladesh  Livestock  and  Nutrition  Activity  (2015-2021)112.  This
project worked to sustainably increase livestock productivity, marketability and consumption
of livestock products for one million livestock producing households. It will feature a strong
digital technology enabled component and it will work across public and private sectors.

60.  Resilience, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood Improvement Project (2021-2026)113.
This  project,  to  be  implement  by  the  Social  Development  Foundation  under  the  Ministry  of
Finance and funded by the World Bank, aims to improve livelihoods of the poor and extreme
poor, enhance their resilience and support rural entrepreneurship in project areas. It will scale
up the approach piloted by the Nuton Jibon Livelihood Improvement Project in targeting the
poor and the poorest, and work on graduating them out of poverty through income-generating
activities, skills development and employment support.

Strategic recommendations

Lessons learned
61.  Targeting  vulnerable  areas  and  ensuring  longer-term  climate  resilience.  IFAD-
supported  projects  have  successfully  targeted  the  worst  poverty  stricken  and  climatically
vulnerable  areas  of  the  countries114.  At  the  same  time,  experiences  from  both  the  natural
variability  in  the  delta  river  ecosystem  as  well  as  climate  change  impact  projections
demonstrate  that  significant  parts  of  the  country,  including  areas  where  IFAD-supported
interventions take place, may not be protected from being rendered inhabitable or infertile for
agricultural development.

62.  Rural finance programs are successful conduits for broader engagement on social,
environmental  and  climate  issues.  A  large  share  of  IFAD-supported  interventions  in
Bangladesh relate to rural finance programs. Beyond improving access to finance alone, these
programs  are  usually  accompanied  by  training  events  and  other  engagements  that  equally
serve  as  a  way  to  promote  broader  issues,  from  gender-related  activities  to  nutrition  and
disaster management.

63.  Better  inclusion  and  equitable  participation  of  ethnic  minorities  and  prevention  of
child labour is possible through careful planning of interventions. IFAD has, through
the Indigenous Peoples Assistance Service (IPAF) supported the Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural
Development  project.  This  project  has  demonstrated  how  social  inclusion  in  development
projects  can  be  improved,  by  developing  comprehensive  social  inclusion  plans.  Similar
strategies can be applied to target marginalized groups and people with disabilities, as well as
to ensure the prevention of harmful child labour.

64.  Projects can effectively promote ‘safe’ agricultural products in clusters, but farmers
face  constraints  on  the  demand  market  as  well  as  on  input  provision  to  scale  up
further. Under the IFAD-supported  PACE project, a value  chain subproject was carried out
specifically to promote safe vegetables around urban areas115. It was found that by bringing
together  different  actors  in  clusters,  including  organic  input  suppliers,  technical  staff  and
market  actors,  the  entire  production  system  could  be  changed.  By  being  able  to  tap  into

premium  markets  and  recognizing  cost  savings  from  more  efficient  application  of  inputs,
farmers now demand safe inputs. However, the larger demand for safe vegetables across the
country is still limited, and so is the provision of safe inputs.

65.  General  improvements  in  nutrition-related  health  indicators  may  have  plateaued,
creating a need for new, tailored approaches. Bangladesh has made significant progress
in  nutrition-related  indicators  such  as  stunting,  which  is  to  a  large  degree  attributed  to
improved incomes, education and healthcare as well as smaller family sizes. A recent study
found that such broad-based improvements may however have plateaued, leaving still high
levels of stunting in the more difficult to reach, chronically poor areas, while at the same time
new challenges in nutrition are rising116. This implies that new community-based strategies
are needed to target more explicitly those groups with tailored nutrition-related interventions.

Strategic orientation, actions and monitoring
66.  Based on the analysis carried out in this SECAP Background Study, this section lists the SECAP-
related recommendations for the strategic orientation of the Bangladesh COSOP 2023 – 2028,
specific actions and the associated core indicators for monitoring:

67.  Ensure  enhanced  climate  change  adaptation  strategies  are  underlying  all  IFAD-
supported  interventions  while  also  actively  promoting  a  low-carbon  emission
development pathway. Climate change adaptation aspects are already integrated into most
IFAD-supported  programs  in  Bangladesh.  They  could  benefit  from  further  enhancement,
including through (i) better understanding the interplay between measures to improve climate
resilience  of  specific  project  activities,  e.g.  flood-protected  infrastructure  or  climate-smart
agriculture, and the adaptation or coping strategies of the target groups; (ii) strengthening
capacity to ensure localized adaptation strategies can be adopted, e.g. improving the analysis
of local impacts of climate change and adopting area-based adaptation strategies where for
instance  climate-resilient  irrigation  infrastructure  development  is  combined  with  improved
submergible  roads  and  climate  smart  agriculture,  (iii)  increasing  the  emphasis  on  climate
smart  agriculture,  for  instance  by  introducing  stress  tolerant  varieties  and  promoting
leguminous crops to increase the water retention capacity of the soil and counter salinization;
and  (iv)  setting  up  cross-project  learning  exchanges  on  climate  change  adaptation  in
collaboration  with  other  relevant  development  partners  specializing  in  these  matters.  In
tandem,  climate  change  mitigation  efforts  should  be  actively  promoted  wherever  feasible,
adopting  the  targets  from  the  NDC  and  potentially  from  sectoral  action  plans  as  they  are
developed during the period covered by this COSOP.

Associated indicators: CI 3.2.2. Households reporting adoption of environmentally
sustainable and climate resilient technologies and practices; CI 3.1.4. Land brought under
climate resilient management; CI 3.1.1. Groups supported to sustainable manage natural
resources and climate related risks; CI 3.1.2: Persons provided with climate information
services; CI 3.2.1. GHG emissions avoided/sequestered.

68.  Further  tailor  the  design  of  specific  activities  in  IFAD-supported  programs  by
reviewing  and  addressing  the  barriers  for  marginalized  groups  and  persons  with
disabilities  to  participate  and  strengthen  accountability  practices.  IFAD-supported
interventions  in  Bangladesh  already  have  a  strong  targeting  focus  on  the  most  vulnerable
areas and are founded on participatory processes that aim to ensure all stakeholders in those
areas can participate and gain benefits. To further enhance the participation of marginalized
groups, IFAD-supported projects could review in more detail the design of specific activities,
such  as  participatory  rural  appraisals  or  monitoring  and  evaluation  strategies,  to  improve
social  inclusion,  by  explicitly  looking  at  the  marginalized  groups  including  people  with
disabilities and reviewing the barriers they  may face to participate in an equitable manner.
This  may  be  related  to  addressing  the  social  norms  underlying  such  activities  but  also  the
practical considerations in terms of timing, location and time burden of participation. IFAD-
supported projects could use strengthened accountability and feedback mechanisms, including

but  not  limited  to  grievance  redress  mechanisms  built  on  the  evolving  national  and  local
structures, to validate the success of such inclusion measures.

Associated indicators (to be disaggregated by target groups): CI 2.1.2. Persons trained in
income-generating activities or business management; CI 1.1.3. Rural producers accessing
production inputs and/or technological packages; CI 1.1.5: Persons in rural areas accessing
financial services; CI 1.1.8. Households provided with targeted support to improve their
nutrition.

69.  Promote  inclusive  youth  employment  as  a  dedicated  investment,  with  focus  on
professional  skill  development,  job  placement  and  self-employment,  thereby
promoting  decent  work.  While  the  current  IFAD-funded  project  portfolio  is  generating
economic  opportunities  in  the  rural  areas  including  for  youth,  the  inclusion  of  dedicated
activities  aimed  at  youth  will  help  in  increasing  employment  in  this  age  group.  The  IFAD-
funded  HILIP-CALIP  and  PROVATi3  already  have  used  such  an  approach,  which  can  be
replicated in future projects.

Associated indicators (to be disaggregated by age group): CI2.2.1. New jobs created; CI
1.1.3. Rural producers accessing production inputs and/or technological packages.

70.  Increase  emphasis  on  promoting  environmentally  sustainable  intensification  of
production (agricultural and non-agricultural), particularly with regards to nutrition
and  health  impacts,  while  pursuing  circular  economy  opportunities.  In  pursuing
increased  productivity  in  both  agricultural  and  non-agricultural  sectors,  IFAD-supported
projects have an important role to play in ensuring  environmental sustainability. This is for
instance related to including provisions for avoiding the unnecessary, excessive or inadequate
use of agrochemicals and  the safe storage and application of agricultural inputs in general,
the consideration of waste management capacities in the planning of project activities. It also
concerns the topic of food safety and nutrition. This can be partially driven by market demand
as  demonstrated  under  PACE  but  it  can,  in  areas  where  there  is  no  such  demand,  also  be
achieved  through  capacity  building,  better  design  of  interventions  and  enforcement  of
regulations,  for  instance  by  tracing  pesticide  residues.  In  the  same  vein,  IFAD-supported
projects  can  further  expand  the  pursuit  of  circular  economy  opportunities.  Some  circular
economy  activities  are  already  integrated  in  IFAD-supported  projects,  such  as  the  use  of
biogas  as  source  of  renewable  energy,  but  they  could  be  further  expanded  to  for  instance
consider alternative protein sources.

Associated indicators: CI 3.2.2. Households reporting adoption of environmentally
sustainable and climate resilient technologies and practices

Potential for environment and climate co-financing
71.  Given the high vulnerability of Bangladesh to climate change, there are and will continue to
be significant financial resources available for climate adaptation and mitigation-related co-
financing  from  institutions  such  as  the  Green  Climate  Fund  (GCF)  and  Adaptation  Fund.
Equally, environmental financiers such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF) are looking to
ensure  synergies  with  sectoral  investments  projects.  IFAD,  as  accredited  entity  to  those
institutions, is therefore well positioned to mobilize environmental and climate co-financing.

72.  Areas of high potential to mobilize such co-financing include:

(a)

Innovative  climate  resilient  production  systems  in  the  dynamic  Char  areas.
IFAD  and  the  GoB  have  a  track  record  of  investing  in  the  pioneering  of  innovative
approaches,  practices  and  technologies  by  combining  climate  resilient  infrastructure
with income generating activities and climate services, such as the provision of climate-
informed agronomic advice. These projects are generating lessons on what investments
are most suitable for the Char areas, as parts of a extremely dynamic ecosystem, and
could be further scaled up through climate adaptation finance.

(b)  Promoting  the  adoption  of  multi-purpose  nature-based  solutions.    IFAD-
supported projects in Bangladesh have experimented with the use of solutions inspired
by nature, such as the planting of vetiver grass to stabilise slopes. These same solutions

28

Appendix IV

EB 2022/136/R.22

can provide income-generating opportunities, such as the provision of fodder. And, even
if the carbon benefits  are modest, they provide ways to increase carbon storage and
restore healthy soils. Such interventions can be scaled up to replace interventions with
‘grey’  infrastructure  and  can  be  supported  through  adaptation  finance  with  some
mitigation co-benefits.

(c)  Supporting low-carbon pathways to better food systems. In the transition of the
agricultural economy to higher productivity, IFAD-supported projects can play a key role
to ensure that low-carbon pathways are followed. This will strongly feature the use of
renewable energy for rural enterprises (for water pumping and operating equipment)
and  the  promotion  of  carbon-storing  practices  such  as  agroforestry,  but  may  be
extended  to  look  at  the  larger  food  system  to  include  the  carbon  footprint  of  inputs
(such as fertilizers) and the remaining value chain towards the end consumer, including
cold chains. For this purpose, IFAD-supported projects could seek to mobilize climate
change mitigation co-financing, with climate change adaptation as co-benefit.

COSOP preparation process

The steps and activities have been undertaken for preparation of COSOP 2023-28:

1.  COSOP Completion Review: The most significant analysis for preparation of the present COSOP
was done by producing CCR report of the previous COSOP 2012-2022. The CCR was completed
by  reviewing  13  projects  (four  projects  initiated  during  the  earlier  COSOP  2006-2012  but
completed  during  COSOP  2012-22  and  seven  nine  on-going  and  two  completed  from  the
COSOP2012-2022 period. It was shared with all IFAD funded projects to receive comments and
feedback. The CCR report went through an IFAD internal review process.

2.  CCR Validated. The CCR report was presented to the Government (Economic Relations Division,
Ministry of Finance) on 18 January 2022 at a validation workshop presided over by Ms Fatima
Yasmin, Secretary, ERD. The report has been revised to incorporate feedback from the meeting.
3.  Background  studies.  IFAD  country  office  (ICO)  has  commissioned  four  background  studies  by
independent consultants on a)  climate  change adaptation, b)  Poverty, targeting,  inclusion  and
gender, c) financial services and value chain development and application of ICTs, and d) climate
resilient  infrastructure.  These  studies  analysed  current  and  potential  future  situations  of
respective  topics,  consulted  prominent  government  agencies  in  the  respective  area,  consulted
private  sector  and  NGO-MFIs  and  sample  beneficiaries.  The  findings  have  enriched  the
COSOP2023-28  process  in  determining  Strategic  Objectives  and  potential  future  areas  of
investments.

4.  COSOP Mission. An IFAD mission was fielded during 20-31 January 2022 to prepare the COSOP
report  that  consulted  IFAD  funded  projects  (that  is,  government  departments),  bilateral  and
multi-lateral  development  agencies,  FAO,  WFP,  research  organizations,  ethnic  minorities’
representatives and NGO-MFIs. Due to the pandemic no field visits were undertaken during this
mission. However, earlier supervision missions visited beneficiaries of the on-going projects.
5.  Day-long Workshop. A day long workshop  of  was held on 23 January to share  and review  the
findings of the background studies with all projects, IFAD mission members and IFAD Technical
Leads, NGO-MFIs and other sector experts. The workshop highlighted issues critical in each area
of study and recommended future interventions.

6.  Workshop with representatives of ethnic minorities to capture demands and potential intervention

methodologies 27 th of January

7.  Wrap up meeting with ERD. A COSOP mission wrap- up meeting was held on 31 January 2022
with the Economic Relations Division (ERD) of the Ministry of Finance to share draft COSOP.
8.  Meeting with the Minister  of Finance.  IFAD country  program and COSOP was  presented to the
Minister  of  Finance,  Government  of  Bangladesh  on  2  February  2022  who  appreciated  IFAD’s
contribution in rural development and poverty alleviation and extended his support for COSOP.
9.  Meeting  with  Minister  of  Agriculture.  IFAD  country  program  and  COSOP  was  presented  to  the
Minister of Agriculture, Government of Bangladesh on 9 February 2022 who appreciated IFAD’s
contribution  in  agricultural  development  and  poverty  alleviation  and  extended  his  support  for
COSOP.

10.  Validation  workshop.  The  draft  COSOP  was  shared  with  a  broader  group  of  stakeholders  at  a

validation workshop on 22 February 2022.

11.  The  COSOP  was  presented  to  the  IFAD  regional  economist’s  network  and  inputs  were

incorporated.

12.  Consultation with list A countries. A workshop was organized for list A countries to discuss the

COSOP on the 7 th of March

13.  Consultation with UN partners through the UNCT on the 4rd of April

EB 2022/136/R.22

South-South and Triangular Cooperation strategy
I. Introduction

1.  IFAD has increasingly tried to incorporate South-South and Triangular Cooperation (SSTC)
in loan and grant financing activities, as a form of commercial and technical support making
use of existing solutions. The projects and/or programmes financed by IFAD and in-country
partners have developed approaches to provide technical cooperation based on reciprocal
knowledge exchanges between peers.

2.  The  formulation  of  the  new  COSOP  2023-2028  for  the  People’s  Republic  of  Bangladesh
facilitated  an  analysis  of  the  country’s  economic  and  development  context,  identifying
opportunities for SSTC activities. The exercise provides a clear idea of how other countries’
experiences  or  resources  can  be  harnessed,  and  how  Bangladesh  can  share  its  own
experiences  and  resources  with  others.  SSTC  thus  is  not  only  an  instrument  for  sharing
knowledge among countries; it is also a means to promote investments and financial flows
to help countries in their development.

3.  In the framework of the new COSOP, SSTC is important to show the results obtained from
the  rural  development  initiatives  focusing  on  smallholder  agricultural  producers,  and  to
highlight  the  actions  and  results  of  the  progress  achieved  on  the  mainstreaming  themes.
This appendix presents potential areas for SSTC in Bangladesh as well as opportunities for
partnerships that will be explored during the COSOP period. It is also important that SSTC
activities are aligned with the key ongoing policies and programmes that are the focus of
IFAD investments in Bangladesh.

II.      Opportunities for rural development investment promotion and technical
exchanges

4.  Bangladesh  has  established  a  South-South  Cooperation  Cell  (SSCC)  within  the  Economic
Relations Division (ERD) of the Ministry of Finance, which coordinates SSTC activities. South-
South  Cooperation  is  included  in  the  National  Policy  for  Development  Cooperation.  The
Access  to  Information  (A2I)  programme  of  Bangladesh  is  currently  leading  three
platforms118  following  SSTC  approaches  to  facilitate  the  exchange  of  knowledge,
experiences and best practices and find innovative solutions. Bangladesh has also laid  out
its vision to utilize SSC in implementing SDGs119.

5.  The strategic objectives proposed in the COSOP recognise not only IFAD’s contributions in
Bangladesh, but also the Government’s special call to position itself as a provider of technical
assistance  and  South-South  Cooperation  to  other  member  countries  in  the  region  and
beyond.

III.      SSTC engagement rationale

6.  During  the  previous  COSOP  period,  several  SSTC  initiatives  were  implemented.  A  few

examples follow:

a.  PACE project implemented by Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) collaborated
with the Vietnamese development organization Centre for Education and Community
Development  (CECD)  and  received  technical  support  from  Vietnamese  experts  to
expand the crab culture sub-sector.

b.  Hydroponic  fodder,  implemented  by  PKSF,  was  mentioned  on  the  Rural  Solutions

Portal through a collaboration between APR, PMI and SSTC team.

c.  Several stock-taking exercises on climate resilience were organized through an SKD-
APR  collaboration  where  8  projects  from  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal
shared lessons learnt.

d.  The Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, more  well-known by  its acronym
BRAC, provided its expertise on the Graduation approach in a collaboration with IFAD

118 South-South Network for Public Service Innovation, Alliance for Asian Apprenticeship, and South-Asia Civil Registration
Network.

in Kenya. This model is being replicated to Tunisia through a new partnership with
the Government of Tunisia.

7.  The examples listed above show the potential of the activities within the Bangladesh PoLG.
Future opportunities should target the area of post-harvest processing and value addition to
serve both domestic demand and tap into export opportunities. Experiences of other Global
South countries are seen as more relevant for Bangladesh as they involve similar levels of
technology  and  required  investment.  Possible  examples  include  fruit  pulp  processing
(oranges and mangoes), coffee roasting and other high-value technologies, along with the
setting up of various regulatory and certification bodies.

IV.      Partnerships and initiatives

8.  IFAD  works  with  numerous  partners  in  Bangladesh,  many  of  which  are  interested  in
incorporating  SSTC  initiatives  into  their  respective  activities.  Possible  partners  include
DANIDA,  GoN,  Helvetas,  JICA,  AIIB,  IsDB  and  other  bilateral  organizations.  These
organizations have experience working in countries similar to Bangladesh, and can provide
the linkages as well as funding to enable SSTC activities. It is important to keep in mind that
this is not an exhaustive list, since new SSTC activities and partners can be identified by the
Government and/or suggested by stakeholders during the implementation period.

9.  SSTC work and  targeting  could  be oriented  towards vulnerable and traditionally excluded
rural groups, including women, youth and indigenous peoples, as these are mainstreaming
strategic and essential pillars in contributing to the reduction of poverty and malnutrition.

10. In terms of entrepreneurship, capacity-building, information technology and rural financing,
there are opportunities to develop exchanges with other countries in the region that have
obtained positive results in these areas. A partner for this has not yet been determined. In
regard to market access and certifications, it is proposed that work be done with the ITC.

11. One  example  of  SSTC  is  adaptation  of  graduation  model  in  Tunisia  that  was  successfully

developed by BRAC, a famous Bangladeshi NGO.

V.      Conclusion

12. SSTC  responds  to  the  growing  interest  of  developing  countries  to  share  lessons  learned
through knowledge exchange, technology and experience, as well as promoting trade and
investments.  In  this  context,  Bangladesh  could  certainly  benefit  from  SSTC’s  technical
cooperation aspects and promotion of investments.

13. Bangladesh has already developed interesting SSTC initiatives in recent years and should
try to maximize existing experiences to expand the new intervention. In this regard, it will
be  critical  to  mobilise  funds  for  SSTC  initiatives.  IFAD  needs  to  set  up  appropriate  and
diversified financing options and an enhanced institutional architecture for SSTC.

14.  Considering  the  Agenda  2030,  and  especially  SDGs  1  and  2,  and  recognizing  the  great
demand for technical knowledge and investment alternatives expressed by the government,
IFAD is ready to continue to act as a knowledge intermediary and support the exchange of
good practices and investment opportunities during the implementation of the new COSOP.

The  Bangladesh  portfolio  currently  consists  of  seven  ongoing  projects  and  one  project  under  design
stage (CDRS). IFAD has received a request from the government to extend CDSP for another 27 months
with the new project completion and the financial closing dates to 30/06/2024 and 31/12/2024.

ICP is in place at central level. The use of country public financial management systems is extensive for
donor-funded  projects,  especially  in  relation  to  budgeting,  fund  flows,  accounting  and  the  audit.
Budgeting processes are overall well functioning but deficiencies have been noted related to reporting
especially at early stage of the project implementation. Internal controls and internal audit also remain
an area of substantial weakness across the Bangladesh portfolio. All donor funded projects are audited
by FAPAD on a yearly basis. Its performance, in terms of quality and timelines, has improved in recent
years.

The portfolio currently contains three projects with substantial FM inherent risk (CDSP IV, NATP 2 – BD,

42

Appendix IX

EB 2022/136/R.22

and  PROVATI), three projects with Moderate risk (HILIP CALIP, SACP and RMTP) and two projects with
low risk (PACE and WR2CC-ASAP2 Grant).

Lesson learned:

•

•

Finance staff capacity skill need to be strengthened.

Internal control and internal audit functions are in need of improvement;

•  Computerized accounting system for project need to be procured at early stage

•

•

Timelines of financial reporting

Timelines of audit report and follow up of findings/recommendation

Mitigation measures:

•
The main mitigation strategy for financial management includes detailing of financial management
procedures, making the PMO responsible for consolidation, reporting of the financial statement; provide
training to project staff, and hiring qualified staff for the project.

•  Assess the fund flow, internal control and reporting arrangement during the design

•

Efficient organizational arrangements are essential for smooth project implementation

•  Adequate internal control measures should be introduced and used at all levels

Procure  and  set-up  of  appropriate  accounting  software  able  to  produce  the  financial  reporting
•
meeting the government and IFAD requirements, which include recording counterpart funding (both in-
kind materials and labour and cash) contributions.
