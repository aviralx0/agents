# Revised  Operational Guidelines on Targeting 

# I. Introduction 

1. The 2019 Revised Operational Guidelines on Targeting operationalize the 2006 targeting 

policy while reflecting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the "l eav ing no one 

behind " (LNOB) principle 2 and the commitments of the  Eleventh Replenishment of IFAD’s 

Resources (IFAD11) .

2. While IFAD recognizes that there may be a need to update its targeting policy, the 

current priority is to provide guidelines to help address emerging issues on targeting 

during IFAD11. 

3. In the context of IFAD11, emphasis is placed on the LNOB principle, which is central to 

IFAD’s mandate "to invest in rural people to enable them to overcome poverty and 

achieve food security through remunerative, sustainable and resilient livelihoods". 3

4. IFAD is committed to engaging more fully in national policy processes in order to tailor 

country strategic opportunities programmes (C OSOPs) and projects to the specific 

conditions and priorities of partner countries. In -country targeting will play an important 

role in its engagement as governments arrive at decisions regarding the most 

appropriate combination of targeted rural developme nt and investment policies and social 

protection policies to foster an inclusive and sustainable rural transformation. Synergies 

between these two policy strands will be fostered whenever possible. 

# II. IFAD's targeting principles and target groups 

5. IFAD’s comp arative advantage lies in its targeting of the poorest , the poor and the 

vulnerable peoples and those who are most likely to have little access to assets and 

opportunities due to social exclusion and marginalization, as outlined in annex I.

6. As for the relationship between poverty targeting and the choice of investment options, 

IFAD will continue to focus on rural people who are poor and vulnerable but who have 

the potential to take advantage of improved access to assets and opportunities for 

agricultural production and rural income -generating activities. For those who cannot take 

advantage immediately, who are often the poorest, the Fund will proactively promote a

gradual approach to facilitat e their access to resources and enable them to bene fit from 

interventions in the future. 

7. While IFAD targeting can be flexible enough to include relatively better -off groups, the 

theory of change (T oC) should be clearly set out to describes how the poorest would 

benefit from the inclusion of such groups an d outline measures for ensuring that this 

occurs, along with their respective monitoring indicators.    

> 2See interim draft of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group operational guide Leaving No One Behind (March
> 2019): https://undg.org/wp -content/uploads/2019/04/Interim -Draft -Operational -Guide -on -LNOB -for -UNCTs.pdf .
> 3See IFAD Strategic Framework 2016 -2025. Enabling Inclusive and Sustainable Rural Transformation (EB
> 2015/116/R.4/Rev.1), p.iii. 2

8. The IFAD targeting policy defines the Fund’s targeting approach based on the following 

methods and measures: 

(i) Geographic targeting to select the poorest or most vulnerable areas within a 

country or region; 

(ii) Direct targeting is linked to the choice of eligibility criteria when services and 

resources are to be channelled to specific individuals or households; 

(iii) Self -targeting measures include the provision of goods and services that are 

aligned with the priorities, assets, capacities and livelihood strategies of the 

identified target groups, while at the same time being of little interest to other 

groups; 

(iv) Enabling measures to promote a policy and institutional environment among 

stakeholders and partners that is favourable to poverty targeting; 

(v) Procedural measures to facilitate transparency in administrative procedures and 

remove unintended obstacles that may hinder social inclusion and gender equality; 

and 

(vi) Empowering and capacity -building measures to develop the capacity and self -

confidence of those with less of a voice and less power so that they can articulate 

their needs and participate in planning, decision -making and project activities. 

9. IFAD’s new targeting principles include: 

(i) Targeting the poorest, the poor and the vulnerable rural people and those who are 

more likely to be left behind; 

(ii)  Mainstreaming  gender, youth, nutrition and environmental and climate issues in 

the operationalization of the targeting process  in COSOPs and projects; 

(iii) Recognizing the dynamic nature of poverty and the importance of tackling the 

multiple forms of vulnerability; 

(iv) Aligning targeting with government poverty reduction priorities, policies and 

strategies; 

(v) Ensuring that working with relatively better -off stake holders 4 results in direct 

benefits for the poorest; 

(vi) Testing innovative targeting approaches by strengthening existing partnerships 

and establishing new ones; 

(vii) Adopting consultative and participatory approaches to targeting; and 

(viii) Empowering and building th e capacity of those who have less of a voice and 

fewer assets. 

# III. IFAD targeting in COSOPs and projects 

10. The targeting process in the IFAD project cycle will involve the analysis and prioritization 

of target groups and a targeting strategy, both for COSOPs and for projects. COSOPs are 

developed jointly with national governments and local stakeholders and are based on 

each country’s goals and visions, their contribution to the 2030 Agenda, and IFAD’s 

mandate a nd comparative advantage .

11. Figure 1 shows a simplified version of the relevant LNOB steps for targeting. This process 

includes the identification of target groups using a variety of assessment tools, the 

definition of investments to support them and the mo nitoring of progress , evaluation and 

accountability.

A. Targeting in COSOPs 

12. The primary objective of a COSOP is to ensure that IFAD's investments promote inclusive 

and sustainable rural transformation while reducing poverty (SDG 1) and food insecurity 

(SDG 2). COSOPs require an analysis of the rural poverty sit uation that includes an 

assessment of the target group’s livelihoods and opportunities so that the Fund can tailor 

its investments in line with the country's goals and priorities and the LNOB principle. 

STEP 1:  WHO , WHERE AND WHY?  – POVERTY  ANALYSIS 

13.  The COSOP should be based on an analysis of the national poverty situation and should 

indicate  which groups are bei ng targeted and where.  The analysis of rural poverty 

and target groups, together with a specific analysis of the relevant mainstreaming issues, 

will inform the determination  – in consultation with the government and stakeholders  –

of  which  types of projects and interventions  should  be included in the country 

programme and  why .

A.  An aly sing  national  and rural poverty situations  and rural livelihoods 

14. These analyses should include a detailed description of who the rural poor are, where 

they live, why they are poor and wh ich groups are most likely to be left behind .

The y should provide information, disaggregated by target group, on: 

(i) socio -economic status and livelihood profiles; (ii) food and nutrition insecurity; (iii) 

environmenta l degradation and climate vulnerability; (iv) vulnerability coping 

mechanisms; and (v) agricultural and income -generating activity potential. The multiple

causes of poverty and deprivation, including exclusion, should also be unpacked. These 

analyses shoul d be summarized in the Social, Environmental and Climate Assessment 

Procedures (SECAP) background study in appendix IV of the COSOP and should be 

informed and validated by the following: 

(i)  Existing  poverty reports and studies . Rural poverty profiles based on national 

household surveys  (e.g. living standards measurement surveys, household budget 

surveys, multiple indicator cluster surveys , and demographic and health surveys )

and census data, including poverty maps; multidimensiona l poverty indicators and 

analysis; rural livelihood assessments and profiles; vulnerability assessments and 

mapping; and other relevant studies; 

(ii)  Primary research for the COSOP  in the absence of the relevant documents listed 

in ( i) or to fill in relevant information gaps, subject to resource availability;  and 

(iii) Consultation and validation with the government and key national 

stakeholders working on poverty eradication policies and programmes that 

represent the interests of those most likely to be left behind, the United Nations 

Country Team and other development partners. These consultations should be 

properly documented. 

B.  Defining the tar get groups 

15. Based on the previous analysis, its disaggregation and the categorization system used in 

the country, priority target groups will be identified and analysed .

STEP 2: WHAT?  - DEFINING THE TARGETING STRATEGY 

A.  St ructuring the country programme and defining the  ToC 

16. A mix of targeting approaches, strategies and thematic investments should be used in 

line with the country’s priorities and IFAD's comparative advantage to meet the needs of 

IFAD's target group. Given th e heterogeneity of the rural poor and the diversity of 

country contexts and priorities, the COSOP’s T oC, articulated in its Results Management 

Framework, should clearly describe the plans for outreach to different target groups and 

explain how the poorest would benefit from including relatively better -off groups in a 

project. 

Who  Why 

What 5

B.  Alignment with national priorities and poverty reduction strategies and 

identi fication of partnership opportunities 

17. Mechanisms should be established for policy engagement, coordination and scaling up 

with a view to generating synergies and complementarities with existing government 

programmes. 

18. A review should be undertaken of natio nal poverty reduction strategies, development 

plans, social protection policies and strategies, food security and nutrition policies, and 

other relevant policies and strategies. 

C.  Defining  the targeting strategy and geographic targeting 

19. The criteria used for geographic targeting should be clearly stated and should align 

IFAD's targeting criteria and priority levels (see table 1 in annex V) with government 

priorities. The criteria for geographic targeting, in order of priority, include:            

> Table 1
> Priority le vel Criteria
> Highest Incidence and intensity of poverty
> High Food and nutrition insecurity
> Medium Environmental degradation and climate vulnerability
> Medium Presence of indigenous ,tribal peoples or ethnic minorities
> Medium Number of young people
> Medium Presence and number of specific marginalized or fragile groups
> Medium to low Productive and agroecological potential

20. The priority level may vary depending on the context. The country portfolio and its 

geographic distribution should reflect a compromise between government targeting 

priorities and IFAD’s targeting criteria and priority levels. The criteria should also be 

balanced with existing opportunities in terms of complementarities with other 

interventions. When governments prioritize agricultural growth potential over poverty 

incidence or intensity when selecting target areas, COSOPs should select the poorest 

municipa lities/districts. All COSOPs should indicate how the poorest sectors within the 

target areas will be reached, specifying the pathways to be used, the benefits to be 

provided and the relevant indicators. 

21. COSOP recommendations to target people and groups of peoples in project 

should be based on: 

 Findings from the poverty analysis ;

 Targeting tools developed by the government to reach out to the poorest segments 

of the population , in combin ation with the IFAD targeting approach and measures ;

 Lessons and experience from previous IFAD -supported operations ; and 

 Partnership arrangements with development partners and organizations working 

with IFAD priority groups. 

STEP 3 and STEP 4: HOW?  – MONITORING  PROGRESS AND ADVANCING ALIGNMENT 

WITH THE SDGs/LNOB  PRINCIPLE 

22. COSOPs should be aligned with national priorities and the United Nations Sustainable 

Development Cooperation Framework (formerly known as the United Nations 

Development Assistance Framework) in order to ensure that IFAD play s its part in the 

United Nations effort to achieve the SDGs by 2030. 

23. The targeting strategy should be monitored and evaluated through the annual and 

COSOP results review on the basis of the targets and indicators set out in the COSOP and 

its Results Management Framework, which should include outreach and milestone 

indicators. 

24. The COSOP completion review assesses the COSOP’s overall progress and results 

based on the Results Management Framework. Targeting is a key dim ension of the 

assessment. The completion review fosters accountability in relation to the SDGs and the 6

LNOB principle . The results achieved in targeting the poorest, the poor and the 

vulnerable should be disseminated within relevant forums. 

25. In summary, the minimum requirements for developing a sound poverty targeting 

strategy and establishing accountability in COSOPs are summarized in box 1. 

Box 1 

B. Targeting at project design 

26. The targeting process initiated during the design of a COSOP should be implemented in 

all IFAD -supported projects. The following steps should be taken to build in targeting 

accountability at the project design stage: 

STEP 1: WHO, WHERE AND WHY?  – POVERTY  ANALYSIS AND DEFINING  TARGET 

GROUPS 

A.  Conducting poverty and target group analyses in the project area 

27. Within the geographic areas of intervention, a combination of the following elements 

should be employed :

(i) Rapid assessment surveys can be undertaken that make use of available poverty 

data and studies for the target areas; 

(ii)  Interviews and focus group discussions  in target areas to complement 

secondary information can be held using participatory tools (participatory rural 

appraisals/participatory learnin g and action )5 to improve disaggregation and 

profiling of target groups at the community level. The  informants should be 

representative of the  target population (sex, age, ethnicity, poverty level); 

(iii)  Faster Implementation of  Project  Start -up instruments and grants  from 

partner organizations or domestic funding can be used to carry out ad hoc poverty 

studies  when the project is in need of a more in -depth diagnostic study; 

(iv)  Data and other information gathered by existing projects  can be  drawn upon 

in areas where new projects will support the scaling up and scaling out of these 

projects;  and 

(v) Results and data from impact assessments that have been carried out by IFAD 

or other agencies can be used.  

> 5

Participatory rural appraisals include participatory tools and approaches for rapidly analysing the situation in rural commun ities 

and for arriving at wealth rankings and livelihood profiles. Participatory learning and action schemes include tools and 

approaches for enabling and empowering poor people to analyse and enhance their knowledge about their lives and livelihoods. 

 The COSOP should be grounded in sound poverty and livelihood analysis and profiling, which should also cover 

environmental degradation, climate vulnerability and productive potential using national definitions. This analysis should 

be disaggregated by IFAD 's priority target groups. 

 Consultations should be held  with  key national stakeholders. 

 The COSOP’s  alignment with national priorities  and  poverty reduction strategies  should be demonstrated, and 

partnership opportunities should be identified .

 Preliminary IFAD interventions should be identified  on the basis of the poverty analysis, the needs and potentials of 

the target groups, government priorities and strategies,  and IFAD’s comparative advantages. 

 A targeting strategy  should be developed based on the poverty analysis, studies and consultations, including: 

- A preliminary identification of project location based on the poverty analysis and geographic targeting .

- Targeting approaches used by the various projects should be  based on lessons from previous operations, should 

be in line with IFAD and government approaches and should take different target groups into account (see 

annexes  IV  and  V). 

 A ToC  should be developed which  outlines  the pathways to achieve the desired pov erty reduction impact. When 

relatively better -off beneficiaries are included, the ToC should demonstrate how the poorest will benefit; otherwise the 

investment will not be approved. 

 The  Results Management Framework  should incorporate outreach indicators,  disaggregated by poverty level or 

some proxy indicator, and should be aligned with the  Sustainable Development  Cooperation Framework  in order to 

foster alignment with the SDGs. 7

B.  Identifying  the target groups 

28. The prioritization of IFAD’s target groups should be based on government priorities, the 

poverty characteristics of the project area and IFAD’s mandate and comparative 

advantage. 

29. Target group prioritization should reflect the COSOP analysis and be tailored to the 

characteristics of the project area and the project’s thematic focus. Depending on the 

context, these groups should include: 

(i) The poorest, the poor and the vulnerable (as per national definitions), on a 

disaggregated basis ;

(ii) Specific vulnerable groups, cutting across the typologies of rural poor , can 

be identified on the basis of a combination of poverty, socio -economic and cultural 

characteristics, with a special focus on inequalities based on sex , age, ethnicity and 

disability; 

(iii) People living in fragile contexts (e.g. refugees, pastoralists, etc. ); and 

(iv) Feasible targets for the participation of each group should be formulated in 

the lo gical framework . Targets should be ambitious and informed by the results of 

previous projects or activities conducted in similar contexts. 

STEP 2: WHAT?  – DEVELOPING  THE TARGETING STRATEGIES 

30. Differentiated targeting strategies, approaches and measures should be used to 

ensure outreach to the different target groups. The project design report ( PDR )

should describe the targeting criteria and processes, in line with gover nment and IFAD 

policies. 6

A.  Defining  the criteria for geographic targeting at the project level 

31. Criteria for geographic targeting should be specified and should refer to the COSOP 

commitments at the following levels: 

(i) Region/departments/provinces 

(ii) Municipalities/districts 

(iii) Communities/villages 

B.  Defining the targeting criteria  to target people and groups of people 

32. Ideally, one or a mix of the following approaches should be used, depending on the 

activities involved: 

(i) Community -based targeting. This kind of targeting should be conducted in 

consultation with the relevant communities and other local stakeholders and can 

include wealth -ranking as an output of community -based targeting and/or 

community validation of government tools .

(ii) Direct targeting . This form of targeting can be based on government social 

registries and the categorization of eligibility for targeted programmes using asset -

based indicators or an asset index, quality -of -life index, membership in 

organizations of the rural poor and/or e asily verifiable demographic poverty 

markers or proxies (e.g. woman -headed households, household dependency ratio) .

(iii) A mix of self -targeting, enabling and menu -based measures . In this case the 

target group is not identified on the basis of eligibility crite ria but instead by 

creating pro -poor incentives, services and conditions for 

self -selection and participation. 

C.  Defining the rationale for the intervention and the “pathway out of poverty”  

> 6See the targeting policy, the IFAD Policy on Engagement with Indigenous Peoples, and IFAD Policy on Gender Eq uality
> and Women’s Empowerment.

8

33. The definition of project interventions should be based on the nee ds of the target groups. 

The rationale for the intervention should also set out the specific pathway out of 

poverty to be promoted and informed by the project’s T oC. 

34. Measures to empower the poor and socially excluded are a key pillar of IFAD's 

targeting approach. IFAD implements a gradual approach in which the sequencing of 

interventions facilitates the strengthening of resilience and the building of the productive 

and organizational capacity of the rural poor, enabling them to engage with markets and 

participate in rural institutions. Community -driven development projects can leverage 

efforts to achieve these objectives. 

35. Three simplified scenarios can be envisaged for project interventions:

 Measures to ensure participation of the poor 

and poorest in development activities 

(e.g. selecting sectors and crops where these 

groups are overrepresented; removing 

barriers to participation such as excessive 

priv ate contribution requirements )7

 Implementation of pro -poor services and 

approaches to extension initiatives and 

capacity development, including household 

mentoring and/or the Gender Action Learning 

System, and building a community -based 

peer -to -peer coaching and extension system 

 Empowerment and capacity development 

measures for building skills and strengthening 

participation in key decision -making bodies 

 Fostering a gradual approach that enables 

the poorest groups being supported under 

scenario 1 to t ransition into development 

components and activities 

 Opening up access to both on -

and off -farm employment, often 

by providing skills development 

and vocational training and by 

fostering an enabling 

environment for generating 

decent jobs 

 Access to infrastr ucture and 

services (e.g. roads that lower 

the transportation costs for 

businesses, health centres and 

schools) 

 Improved supply of nutritious 

food and a diversified diet (e.g. 

nutrition -sensitive value chains)

Ensure that the targeting approach is 

appropriate and effective, which may require 

phasing through a sequence of projects 

Ensure mechanisms are in 

place to facilitate direct benefits 

to the poorest and the poor and 

carefully monitor the results and 

impact  

> 7

Excessive private contribution requirements block the participation of the poorest households. Special windows should be 

created that target the poorest, and the private contribution should be affordable for the poor and t he poorest. 9 

> Figure 3
> Potential synergies among scenarios 1, 2 and 3

D.  Defining  partnerships as a means of engaging with the most vulnerable 

36. Partners should be identified and the partnership arrangements and the type s of 

targeting activities that will be co -implemented should be described. This may include: 

(i) Line ministries, specialized government agencies dealing with social protection and 

other poverty eradication programmes; 

(ii) NGOs and United Nations agencies (e.g. WFP, the International Labour 

Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the 

United Nations Children’s Fund) or international financial institutions working with 

the most vulnerable segments of the population; and 

(iii) Local civi l society organizations that represent the interests of the poorest/most 

vulnerable (e.g. women’s and indigenous peoples’ organizations). 

E.  Fostering an enabling institutional and policy environment for poverty targeting 

37. Proposed activities could include t he following: 

(i) Provision of technical support to the government to improve poverty information 

systems and foster policy dialogue involving the most vulnerable social groups; 

(ii) Mechanisms and procedures for enhancing community participation and ensuring 

that target groups are covered in the programme implementation manual (PIM); 

(iii) Based on the principle of citizen engagement , the project management unit (PMU) 

operates in a transparent and participatory way in close consultation with project 

participants; and 

(iv) Se nsitization and capacity development activities with local institutions, leaders and 

implementing partners, including the private sector, to equip them to reach out to 

project target groups. 

F.  Costab computations and the project budget are informed by povert y

considerations 

38. The share of investments reaching different target groups can be monitored by 

specifying :

(i) The overall cost of specific activities/subcomponents targeting the most vulnerable; 

(ii) Dedicated staff (human resources); and 

(iii) The percentage of matching grants earmarked for specific groups. 

The poorest have their 

immediate needs  –

including food insecurity and 

nutrition vulnerability  –

addressed  (Scenario 1) 

The poorest and the poor 

graduate  into sustainable 

economic activities 

(Scenario 2) 

The poorest and the poor 

benefit from projects that 

include better -off farmers 

through wage employment, 

increased market access 

and access to nutritious 

food  (Scenario 3) 10 

G.  Drafting the PIM and defining implementation arrangements 

39. In order for the PIM to properly cover the issues related to project -level targeting, it is 

necessary to: 

(i) Envisage the appointment of a social inclusion and targeting officer; 

(ii) Describe the partners that will implement the targeting strategy (e.g. local NGOs, 

other development agencies, sector ministries, social protection programmes); 

(iii) Specify the targeting p rocess (community -based targeting; poverty criteria; 

decision -making processes, including the composition of selection committees); and 

(iv) Provide a more detailed description of implementation arrangements in the PIM 

and an accurate definition of the targetin g process and tools, as shown in box 2. 

Box 2 

 Provide clear tools, procedures and processes  for selecting communities  on the basis of  poverty and economic 

potential criteria 

 Include approaches that focus on the poorest, poor and vulnerable people 

 Provide  examples of targeting best practices  that illustrate how targeting should be operationalized 

 Define procedures for enhancing transparency, community participation and ownership, including: 

- Information and outreach regarding criteria and  procedures  for the  participation of all intended target groups 

should be made available 

- All information concerning the project, including the prioritization of selected participants,  should be  transparent 

and  made  accessible to all 

- Complaints and grievances of local communities and other local stakeholders  should be  described 

- Information on the number and type s of consultation s and outreach activities, including the number and social 

characteristics of the participants,  should be  re corded as part of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system 

 Specify monitoring indicators for targeting  based on the socio -economic classification of the target group used in 

the PDR 

 Include targeting in the annual workplan and budget (AWP/B) 

 Develop the  terms of reference  for: 

- Targeting and social inclusion officer 

- Relevant service providers 

 Draft the targeting implementation plan , including social outreach activities and pre -identification of participants at 

start -up: 

(i)  Start -up phase (pre -investment  – usually  four  to  six  months) 

- Information and communication activities in the project area to ensure that target segments are informed 

about the project’s activities 

- Social mobilization to identify local demands and pre -select target groups 

(ii)  Investment phase 

- Capacity development and sensitization to build the capacity of service providers and stakeholders in 

poverty targeting 

- Definition of activities targeted at the poorest and other target groups, along with clear milestones 

- Workshops and policy dialogue 

STEP 3  and STEP 4: HOW?  - MONITORING PROGRESS AND ADVANCING ALIGNMENT 

WITH THE SDGs AND  THE  LNOB PRINCIPLE 

A.  Integrating into IFAD's Operational Results Management System  – indicator s

for outreach  outcome and outputs disaggregated by target groups  s

40. The M&E system should include clear poverty and/or socio -economic classifications. For 

example, in the absence of monetary and/or multidimensional poverty indicators, socio -

economic classification s or government poverty -ranking tools can be used to classif y

target groups according to their poverty level. 

B.  Designing mechanisms for  participatory and learning -oriented monitoring 

41. This should also be regarded as a specific output of the project. Participatory and 

learning -oriented monitoring provides a space fo r the poor to voice their needs and 

concerns during implementation. 11 

C.  Monitoring the risks associated with poverty targeting 

42. Specific risks associated with targeting should be identified during SECAP preparation, 

and mitigation measures should be included in the SECAP review note: 

(i) Risk of undercoverage . Self -targeting and enabling measures are put in place to 

incentivise target groups to participate in the interventions .

(ii) Leakage and excessive elite capture . A strong monitoring system should enable 

the PMU to detect excessive elite capture and introduce more stringent criteria to 

ensure a more equitable distribution of project benefits .

(iii) Social exclusion and conflicts . The targeting approach needs to be tailored to 

the target groups in order to avoid social tensions. 

43.  The  minimum requirements  for developing a sound poverty targeting strategy and 

accountability scheme in design documents are summarized below: 

Box 3                                      

> Poverty and target group analyses should be included in the PDR in order to leverage the analysis done in the
> COSOPs in consultation with local stakeholders, including poor rural communities
> The target group should be analysed along poverty and social -cultural lines on the basis of national defini tions of
> poverty and vulnerability
> The project’s T oCshould set out clear pathways for reaching and benefiting the poorest, the poor and the vulnerable.
> Atargeting strategy should be developed which includes:
> -Poverty -focused criteria and cross -cutting pr iorities for the selection of target areas;
> -A clear definition of activities, approaches and subcomponents for reaching and benefiting specific poverty
> segments; and
> -Mechanisms for the implementation of the targeting strategy
> The financial and human resour ces needed to deliver activities for poverty targeting should be reflected in the Costab
> computations and the AWP/B
> Partnerships for poverty targeting should be clearly described
> Measures for fostering an enabling policy environment should be set out
> The result s-based framework should incorporate outreach indicators, disaggregated by poverty level, and a participatory
> monitoring system

C. Targeting during implementation 

44. The implementation of the project’s targeting strategy should be based on the activitie s

and processes previously identified in the PDR and the implementation arrangements 

and procedures defined in the PIM .

45. Two activities are critical in this phase of the programme cycle: 

(i) Project start -up (including the start -up mission and the start -up phase); and 

(ii) Direct supervision (including the midterm review) and implementation support 

missions. 

STEP 2:  WHAT?  – SUPPORTING THE OPERATIONALIZATION OF THE TARGETING 

STRATEGY 

A.  Reviewing and consolidating the implementation plan and arrangements 

defined in the PIM 

46. This should be done in close consultation with PMU staff, including the programme 

coordinator, the M&E specialist and the social inclusion and targeting officer. 

47. The targeting implementation plan should be reviewed and validated. It should include a 

well -designed project implementation schedule , complete with project deliverables 

and the corresponding timing. 

B.  Raising awareness of the poverty targeting strategy and project targeting tools 

48. The start -up phase begins with the start -up workshop and usually lasts from four to six 

months. During that period, awareness of project activities should be raised with a vie w

to mobilizing local demand and encouraging people to participate in project activities. 12 

49. Appropriate channels should be used to disseminate information within the community 

about the forthcoming investment, the menu of activities th at is envisaged and th e

eligibility criteria and procedures for accessing the project. These channels may include 

local radio stations, community -based organizations, women’s groups, youth football 

clubs, churches, etc. 

50. The process should be documented. 

STEP 3 and STEP 4:  HOW?  - MONITORING PROGRESS AND ADVANCING ALIGNMENT 

WITH THE SDGs AND LNOB PRINCIPLE 

51. Direct supervision, midterm review and implementation support missions provide a 

uniquely effective instrument for monitoring progress in the implementation of the 

targeti ng strategy, detecting challenges, learning from mistakes and proposing changes 

to foster poverty outreach and impact. 

A.  Assessing the effectiveness of the targeting strategy in reaching and benefiting 

the intended target group 

52. The supervision mission will assess the extent to which the project is reaching the 

intended target groups, particularly the poorest and the “hard to reach”. Targeting 

performance should be assessed against: 

(i) Available M&E derived from both quantitative and qualitative tools and metrics that 

combine the two; 

(ii) The views of local stakeholders as expressed through focus group discussions and 

participatory rural appraisals; and 

(iii) The views of key informants, including the PMU, service providers and partner 

organizations. 

53. The analysis an d subsequent score (from 1 to 6) should be based on the following: 

(i) Outr each to different target groups. The assessment should explore the extent 

to which different target groups, as identified at design and in the PIM, are 

participating in and benefit ing from project activities. Verification methods include 

M&E information and consultations with local stakeholders. Targeting challenges 

and mistakes, including undercoverage and elite capture, should be discussed with 

PMU staff and service providers in orde r to reach agreement on potential 

corrections. A specific performance rating on targeting and outreach needs to be 

attributed during supervision missions. 

(ii) Implementati on (readiness or effectiveness). The implementation of the 

targeting strategy should refl ect the implementation plan prepared at 

start -up and should follow the criteria, processes and budgetary provisions 

established in the PIM. If the project is in its first year of implementation, the actual 

readiness of implementers and PMU staff should be assessed by inquiring about 

their level of awareness of the targeting strategy. Similarly, knowledge about the 

project’s initiatives, conditions for participation and procedures for the different 

groups of potential beneficiaries should be evaluated. 

(iii) Val idity of targeting tools and methods. The effectiveness of the targeting 

approach should be assessed. If required, recommendations for improvements, in 

consultation with local stakeholders, should be provided. 

(iv) Effectiveness of the M&E system in assessing targeting performance. The 

M&E system should be assessed on the basis of its effectiveness in capturing both 

quantitative and qualitative information on targeting performance .

B.  Proposing practical changes and tools for improving targeting performance 

54.  Recommendations  should be made regarding ways of improving the targeting process, 

targeting  tools and overall performance. 13 

Table 3 

Minimum standards for addressing targeting in supervision and midterm review missions 

(i) The services of a social inclusion (gender, youth, indigenous peoples) targeting expert is required at the time that the 

midterm review mission is carried out, and the presence of an expert on cross -cutting issues is desirable. 

(ii) Poverty profiling of the target population should be conducted if it is not already available in the PDR or if no adequate 

baseline survey exists. 

(iii) The  project’s  targeting strategy should be assessed in close consultation with project participants, staff and implementing 

partners as a basis for identifying the adjustments needed to improve outreach to the poorest, poor and vulnerable 

people in rural areas. 

(iv) In the  absence  of  targeting performance monitoring tools,  technical support should be provided to assist project staff to 

incorporate targeting and social inclusion components into M&E and knowledge management activities. 

(v) Best  practices  and lessons learned shou ld be identified and disseminated. 

D. Targeting at completion 

55. With respect to targeting and outreach, the project completion report should include a 

critical analysis of the project’s targeting strategy and an assessment of how well it 

performed with a view to informing both project scaling -up efforts and future proj ects 

and country strategies. 

STEP 3 and 4: HOW?  – MONITORING PROGRESS AND RESULTS AND ADVANCING 

ALIGNMENT WITH THE SDGs AND LNOB PRINCIPLES 

56. The monitoring assessment of targeting and outreach should cover the following aspects: 

implementation arrangements, the project targeting strategy, the contribution of the 

targeting approach to project outcomes and the potential for using the targeting 

approach in scaling -up activities under new programmes. 

A.  Lessons learned 

57.  The assessment provides an  opportunity to consider and document lessons learned on 

targeting. Lessons learned should be systematized and shared with national stakeholders 

and beyond. 

Table 4 

Minimum standards for assessing targeting during project completion missions 

(i) The services  of  a social inclusion and targeting expert  are  required at completion. Expertise on cross -cutting issues 

(nutrition, etc.) is recommended. 

(ii) The  thematic  assessment of targeting should start with a review of the project M&E system as  its  main source of 

information. 

(iii)  Surveys  and data -gathering activities should be planned during the early stages of the completion process. 

(iv)  Participatory  evaluation methodologies , in which  the various target groups are actively involved , should be used to 

supplement or validate the survey findings. 

(v) A stakeholder workshop involving beneficiary groups, civil society and participating donors should be organized to 

discuss targeting issues. Supplementary workshops can be organized to facilit ate the participation of particular 

segments  of the population. 

(vi) Best  practices  and lessons learned on targeting should be systematized, and appropriate channels should be identified 

for the dissemination of the knowledge generated during the mission.
