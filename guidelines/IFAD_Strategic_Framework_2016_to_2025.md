The IFAD Strategic Framework 2016 -2025 

was prepared by the Strategy and Knowledge 

Department (SKD) under the overall 

guidance of the Executive Management 

Committee (EMC) chaired by the President 

of IFAD, Kanayo F. Nwanze. Josefina  Stubbs, 

Associate Vice-President (SKD), led the 

team that produced the Framework, 

assisted by Paul  Winters. Hisham Zehni 

had responsibility for integrating various 

contributions and finalizing the document 

with support from a core team consisting of 

Tim  Balint, Hansdeep  Khaira and Alena Lappo. 

A focus group (comprising staff across IFAD 

departments) actively supported the team with 

extensive inputs from Edward Heinemann and 

Geoffrey Livingston. 

Earlier drafts were discussed with IFAD 

Management and staff at various meetings. 

Two informal seminars of the Executive Board 

were held to gather feedback and inputs from 

Board representatives. Among the external 

groups consulted were the members of 

the Orientation Committee of the Farmers’ 

Forum at IFAD, the Steering Committee 

of the Indigenous Peoples’ Forum at IFAD 

and the International Agri-Food Network 

(private  sector). 

The EMC gratefully acknowledges the 

invaluable guidance and many contributions, 

comments and suggestions received 

throughout the process, all of which were 

of tremendous value in the preparation and 

finalization of the Framework. 

The IFAD Strategic Framework 2016-2025 

was approved by the Executive Board in 

February  2016. 3

# President’s foreword 

The IFAD Strategic Framework 2016-2025 

is an articulation of IFAD’s Strategic Vision 

for the same period, and for the first time 

embraces three replenishment periods 

(IFAD10, 11 and 12). It was prepared in 2015, 

a year of momentous change for international 

development marked by the adoption of the 

2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 

the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the 

Paris Agreement under the United Nations 

Framework Convention on Climate Change. 

Together, these resolutely and urgently call 

for an end to poverty and hunger through 

stronger partnerships, policies and investments 

that promote economically, socially and 

environmentally sustainable development. 

Importantly, they recognize that smallholder 

agricultural development and inclusive and 

sustainable rural transformation are essential to 

meeting these commitments. 

Realizing these commitments calls for ambition 

and bold action on everyone’s part. This is 

the spirit with which IFAD’s new Strategic 

Framework has been developed. Building on 

what it has accomplished over the last decade 

in transforming its business and financial 

model, expanding its programme of work, and 

improving the impact of its operations, IFAD 

is well positioned to play a larger role in the 

inclusive and sustainable transformation of rural 

areas and livelihoods. 

Going forward, IFAD aims to maximize its 

comparative advantage in unleashing the 

potential of poor rural people by working in a 

way that is bigger, better and smarter. To do 

this, it will mobilize and leverage substantially 

greater investment in rural areas; strengthen 

the quality of countries’ rural development 

programmes through evidence-based 

innovation, knowledge-sharing, partnerships 

and policy engagement; and deliver 

development results more cost-effectively. 

As the development context is bound to 

change, this Strategic Framework will be 

periodically reviewed and updated during its 

10-year lifespan to ensure that IFAD remains 

highly relevant throughout. 

This Framework is the product of the drive and 

ideas of IFAD staff and Management, Member 

States and external partners, all of whom 

I would like to thank for their active role in 

its  development.

# Executive summary 

IFAD’s fifth Strategic Framework presents the 

overarching goal, principles of engagement, 

strategic objectives, outcomes and pillars of 

results delivery that will guide IFAD’s operations 

over the 2016-2025 period. It situates IFAD 

in the evolving global context and articulates 

its contribution to the 2030 Agenda for 

Sustainable Development (Agenda 2030). 

Agenda 2030 offers clear evidence that 

IFAD’s mandate of investing in rural people 

and enabling inclusive and sustainable 

transformation of rural areas, notably through 

smallholder agriculture-led growth, is of 

absolute global relevance today and over the 

coming decade. After several years of growth 

and reform, IFAD is now recognized for its 

experience, knowledge and performance in 

this domain; it stands ready to achieve greater 

impact and it is well positioned to play a larger 

role in helping countries fulfil their priorities 

relative to Agenda 2030. For it to do so, it 

needs to work in a way that is bigger, better 

and smarter: 

• Bigger : by mobilizing substantially more 

funds and resources for investment in 

rural areas; 

• Better : by strengthening the quality of 

IFAD’s country programmes through 

innovation, knowledge-sharing, 

partnerships and policy engagement; and 

• Smarter : by delivering development 

results in a cost-effective way that 

best responds to partner countries’ 

evolving  needs. 

IFAD is the only United Nations specialized 

agency and international financial institution 

focused exclusively on reducing poverty 

and food insecurity in rural areas through 

agriculture and rural development. It has 

ample experience in contributing to and 

shaping national policies and programmes, 

and in providing investment vehicles for 

governments, other development partners and 

the private sector, with smallholder farmers, 

pastoralists, artisanal fishers and other rural 

people at their centre. It has succeeded in 

significantly expanding its programme of work 

while considerably improving the quality and 

impact of its operations. 

Going forward, IFAD will continue to develop 

and innovate in its areas of comparative 

advantage and thematic focus as defined in 

this framework and its operational policies and 

strategies. Smallholder agriculture and rural 

development programmes will remain at the 

heart of IFAD’s business, as it works to build the 

capacity, productivity and market participation 

of poor rural people, using approaches that 

promote economic and social empowerment. 

IFAD will also continue to focus on vulnerable 

and marginalized rural groups such as women, 

youth and indigenous peoples. 

During the period covered by this framework, 

IFAD’s overarching development goal will be 

to invest in rural people to enable them to 

overcome poverty and achieve food security 

through remunerative, sustainable and 

resilient livelihoods. 

IFAD will pursue three closely interlinked and 

mutually reinforcing strategic objectives (SOs) 

to achieve its goal: 

• SO1 : Increase poor rural people’s 

productive capacities; 

• SO2 : Increase poor rural people’s benefits 

from market participation; and 

• SO3 : Strengthen the environmental 

sustainability and climate resilience of 

poor rural people’s economic activities. 6

In turn, it will strive to achieve three main 

outcomes: 

• Enabling policy and regulatory frameworks 

at national and international levels; 

• Increased levels of investment in the rural 

sector; and 

• Improved country-level capacity for rural 

policy and programme development, 

implementation and evaluation. 

IFAD’s work will consistently adhere to 

five principles of engagement: targeting; 

empowerment; gender equality; innovation, 

learning and scaling up; and partnerships. 

These principles are at the core of IFAD’s 

identity and values, and cut across the delivery 

of all its development results. 

Partnerships – both global and within 

countries – are key for achieving Agenda 

2030. Given the magnitude of IFAD’s 

agenda and the investments required for 

smallholder agriculture development and rural 

transformation, partnerships will continue to be 

central to its work. 

In addition to strengthening successful existing 

partnerships and developing new ones, 

especially with partners with complementary 

areas of expertise, IFAD will continue to 

engage with the international development 

community to build support around global 

issues affecting rural communities. It will 

facilitate multistakeholder partnerships 

between governments, the private sector and 

small-scale rural producers, including through 

South-South and Triangular Cooperation. 

Collaboration with the Rome-based agencies 

will be of strategic priority. 

The four pillars sustaining the achievement 

of IFAD’s development results are its country 

programme delivery; knowledge building, 

dissemination and policy engagement; 

financial capacity and instruments; and 

institutional functions, services and systems. 

The delivery of high-quality and effective 

country programmes will be IFAD’s direct 

means for achieving its objectives. However, 

ensuring that IFAD’s development impact is 

bigger, better and smarter will also require 

state-of-the-art knowledge and evidence, 

proactive engagement in international 

policy processes, mobilization of additional 

resources, diversification of financial products 

to cater to clients’ evolving needs, and an 

effective and efficient institutional platform. 

The Strategic Framework will be at the 

centre of IFAD’s system for managing for 

development results. Performance will be 

measured through the results measurement 

frameworks (RMFs) agreed with Member 

States in the context of IFAD’s replenishment 

consultations. Progress will be reported 

annually to the Executive Board and its 

Evaluation Committee in the Report on IFAD’s 

Development Effectiveness (RIDE), and the 

Annual Report on Results and Impact of 

IFAD Operations (ARRI) produced by the 

Independent Office of Evaluation of IFAD. 7

# 1

## Purpose 

IFAD’s fifth Strategic Framework covers the 

period 2016-2025. It serves as an overarching 

policy guideline to provide direction to 

IFAD’s work, and as a key instrument 

for consolidating IFAD’s development 

effectiveness. The new framework builds on 

and reinforces many of the strategic thrusts of 

the previous one (2011-2015). 1 It responds to 

the evolving global environment and positions 

IFAD to play a crucial role in the inclusive and 

sustainable transformation of rural areas. 2

The framework has four purposes: 

• To situate IFAD relative to key 

development challenges and the larger 

global development architecture, and 

articulate its contribution to the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development 

(Agenda 2030); 

• To define and present IFAD’s overarching 

development goal, principles of 

engagement, strategic objectives, 

outcomes and pillars of results delivery; 

• To orient the development of country 

strategic opportunities programmes 

(COSOPs) and IFAD-supported 

investment projects, global and regional 

grant funded programmes, and new 

policies and strategies; 3 and 

• To provide overall coherence to IFAD’s 

work and guide managers and staff 

across the organization to enable them to 

contribute more effectively to the Fund’s 

overarching development goal and core 

results agenda. 

Its 10-year time frame is a long one, and so 

to ensure its relevance amid changes in the 

broader development context, a midterm 

review will be carried out in 2020 to determine 

the need for any substantive reorientations. 

## Main thrusts 

IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025 

will cover a period in which there are good 

reasons for optimism, given what has been 

accomplished since the establishment of 

the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 

Extreme poverty has declined significantly over 

the last two decades: in 1990, nearly half of 

the population in the developing world lived 

on less than US$1.25 per day; in 2015 only 

14 per cent did so; and the numbers are now 

coming down in all regions. The proportion of 

undernourished people has fallen by almost 

half, from 23 to 13 per cent; and child mortality 

rates have declined by more than half, 

from 90 to 43 deaths per 1,000 live births. 

Huge numbers of people have moved into 

the “working middle class”: this group now 

makes up half the workforce in the developing 

regions, up from just 18 per cent in 1991. 4

However, considerable challenges remain. 

The actual number of people living in extreme 

poverty remains unacceptably high: 836 million 

in 2015. 5 In all regions, rates of poverty and 

hunger are higher in rural areas than in urban 

areas. In many countries, the gap between 

the haves and the have-nots continues to 

expand, and in some, the Gini index is well 

over 0.5. While many developing countries 

register robust rates of GDP growth, a lower 

percentage of the workforce is employed 

today than 25 years ago, and youth 

unemployment is a chronic and unresolved 

social problem as well as an economic 

loss. These challenges are exacerbated by 

problems of environmental degradation and by 

climate change, the impacts of which will be 

felt above all by the most vulnerable groups in 

the developing world – rural women and men. 

This Strategic Framework has been prepared 

against the backdrop of three landmark 

international agreements that together offer a 

demonstration of the international community’s 

commitment to address these and other global 

challenges. Agenda 2030, driven by new 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); a new 

financing framework for development; 6 and a 

new global agreement on climate change will 

provide a platform for the realization of a vision 

of economically, socially and environmentally 

sustainable development that will bring 

extreme poverty and food insecurity to an end 

within a generation. This compelling vision will 

be the compass for every aspect of IFAD’s 

work in the coming decade. 

Agenda 2030 offers clear evidence that IFAD’s 

mandate of investing in rural people is of 

absolute global relevance today and over the 

coming decade. After several years of growth 

and reform, IFAD is now recognized for its 

experience, knowledge and performance in 

the domain of smallholder agriculture and rural 

development, and is ready to play a larger 

role in helping countries achieve their priorities 

relative to Agenda 2030. For it to do so, it 

needs to work in a way that is bigger, better 

and smarter. 

Bigger . The inclusive and sustainable 

transformation of rural areas is central to the 

realization of Agenda 2030. It is essential for 

the ambitious SDGs of eradicating poverty 

(SDG1) and ending hunger and malnutrition, 

achieving food security and promoting 

sustainable agriculture (SDG2); and it is 

also important for many other elements of 

Agenda 2030. However, transformation of 

rural areas will require the mobilization and 

effective use of substantially increased levels of 

financial resources, encompassing both public

> International Conference on Financing for Development in July 2015.

IFAD’s contribution to Agenda 2030 is acknowledged in the Addis Ababa Action 

Agenda adopted at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development 

in July 2015, which states: 

“We recognize the efforts of the International Fund for Agricultural Development in 

mobilizing investment to enable rural people living in poverty to improve their food 

security and nutrition, raise their incomes and strengthen their  resilience.” 9

expenditure and responsible private investment. 

It will require strong commitment and action 

at the national level, supported by continuing 

engagement from the international  community. 

IFAD can make a substantive contribution to 

the achievement of the SDGs, but it must be 

financially equipped to do so. This will require 

a sizeable increase in the IFAD programme of 

work over the framework period: an increase 

that must be driven, at least partially, by an 

expanding programme of loans and grants. 7

Its role therefore will increasingly be one of 

bringing additional resources to the projects it 

supports and the activities they make possible, 

through cofinancing - from both public and 

private sources. IFAD is well prepared to deliver 

bigger; it has amply demonstrated its ability to 

do so over the past decade, when it succeeded 

in more than doubling its programme of work 

while achieving significant improvement in the 

quality and impact of its  operations. 

Better . “Bigger” alone is not sufficient: IFAD’s 

development impact will depend on the quality 

of its programme of work and its success in 

leveraging financial resources and knowledge 

in, through and beyond the programmes it 

supports. This will constitute IFAD’s scaling -up 

agenda. IFAD will strengthen the quality 

of its country programmes, ensuring that 

investment projects, grant-financed activities 

and engagement in national policy processes 

combine to realize greater and more sustainable 

development impact relative to a clear and 

defined set of strategic objectives. IFAD’s 

agenda for working better will consist of several 

critical dimensions: improving its capacity to 

identify innovations that respond to constraints 

faced by rural people, and to incorporate 

and test them within projects; strengthening 

its ability to learn, generate knowledge and 

provide evidence about what works, including 

by leveraging the knowledge of others to 

deepen and complement its own knowledge 

base; enhancing project quality-at-entry and 

implementation support; and strengthening 

partnerships and policy engagement, inter alia, 

through expanded country presence. 

IFAD’s role at the country level will be 

complemented by a stronger, yet focused, 

role at the global level. Drawing on both its 

operational experience and outside expertise, 

it will generate knowledge on issues related to 

inclusive and sustainable rural transformation, 

and it will draw on this knowledge in engaging 

in relevant global policy processes, where it will 

contribute its specific perspective. Conversely, 

the evolving global policy context will need 

to inform all dimensions of IFAD’s work, from 

the corporate to the country levels: working 

better will mean that the linkage is immediate 

and  substantive. 

Smarter.  Achieving “better” also means working 

smarter, that is, delivering development results 

in a cost-effective way that best responds to 

partner countries’ evolving needs. Smarter will 

also entail the most efficient and effective use of 

all resources at IFAD’s disposal, and maximum 

involvement and collaboration from every 

division and department, at headquarters and 

in country offices, as each one has a critical and 

indispensable role to play. 

Key priorities will include: fostering a culture of 

excellence and results across the organization 

and beyond; further rationalizing and 

streamlining key business processes using 

enabling technologies; enhancing the skill sets 

and competencies of IFAD’s workforce in light 

of evolving operational priorities and maintaining 

a high-level of workforce engagement and 

performance; and optimizing efficiency and 

complementarity of functions and knowledge 

flows between IFAD country offices and 

headquarters. Dynamic internal and external 

communication will support these efforts, 

further unify IFAD’s global team, and strengthen 

the Fund’s position as a partner of choice, 

given the critical role that partnerships play in 

everything IFAD does.

to turn to migration, resulting in an ageing 

or a feminization of the rural population, and 

a loss of the human capital needed to drive 

rural transformation. The creation of rural jobs 

and economic opportunities will be a crucial 

challenge in the years to come, if inclusive and 

sustainable rural transformation is to be made 

a reality. 

Rural people and smallholder farmers can 

contribute far more than they currently do to 

growth and job creation, food security and 

nutrition, and the environmental and climate 

change agendas. Despite major constraints 

in access to productive assets and services, 

and to markets, smallholder farmers today 

are the sole or principal food producers in 

many developing countries. They support 

the livelihoods of some 2 billion to 2.5 billion 

people, and manage a large part of the world’s 

natural resources. The Food and Agriculture 

Organization of the United Nations (FAO) 

anticipates that global food supply will have 

to increase by some 70 per cent by 2050. 

For some developing countries this figure is 

even higher. Reduced levels of food loss can 

contribute to increasing supply, but increased 

agricultural production by smallholder farmers 

will be critical. This needs to be driven 

overwhelmingly by raising productivity, given 

the limited scope for expanding the area 

under cultivation without deforestation, and 

moreover, against a backdrop of harsher and 

more uncertain environmental conditions, 

climate change, demographic transitions and 

market transformation. 

Despite the challenges, there is reason for 

optimism given the potential to sustainably 

increase smallholder agricultural productivity 

while reducing vulnerability to environmental 

and climatic shocks. Although yield gaps 

for key staple crops remain huge in many 

developing regions, major improvements 

## The changing context for 

## agriculture  and  rural  development 

The world is becoming more urban. By 2025, 

the end of this Strategic Framework period, 

54  per cent of the population of the developing 

world will be urban. However, in sub-Saharan 

Africa and South Asia – the two regions with 

the highest levels of poverty – 57 per cent 

and 60  per cent respectively of the population 

will  still be rural in 2025, and their rural 

populations will continue to increase for many 

years to  come. 

For rural populations everywhere, the growth 

of urban areas can bring income opportunities 

linked to the development of new supply 

chains serving urban markets and create jobs, 

made accessible via migration or commuting. 

Many small family farms are seizing these 

opportunities to become vibrant enterprises 

catering to new dynamic markets. These small 

businesses are capitalizing upon advantages 

of their size and the use of family labour, 

and combining these with scale efficiencies 

achieved through collective action. Other small 

farms are becoming too small, too poorly 

linked to markets, or too poorly organized to 

be economically viable; and in some parts 

of the developing world, where agricultural 

populations are declining, a process of farm 

consolidation has commenced. 

Over the past two decades, vast numbers 

of rural people have sought to diversify their 

livelihoods and have turned to non-farm 

(though usually agriculture-related) income 

sources. In a growing number of developing 

countries, non-farm sources now account for 

a greater share of rural incomes than does 

agricultural production. Yet, at times, limited 

opportunities for improved livelihoods in rural 

areas also drive vast numbers of rural people

systems or innovate with new technologies. 

In the absence of reliable and remunerative 

marketing outlets for surplus production, 

smallholder farmers will seek to produce 

enough for their household requirements 

and rather invest in alternative, lower risk 

income -generating activities. Weak and 

imperfect markets are often a function – 

in part at least – of inadequate rural 

infrastructure, in particular, farm-to-market 

roads, storage facilities and marketplaces. 

However, while studies persistently demonstrate 

that investments in infrastructure provide high 

returns, large financing gaps remain in many 

developing countries. In  sub -Saharan Africa 

alone funding requirements for infrastructure 

are estimated at US$93 billion a year, 9 with a 

funding gap of US$31 billion. 

Finally, rural poverty is frequently a 

consequence of the way in which rural people 

are marginalized. This may be the result of 

many factors, such as remoteness, limited 

access to information and services, weak 

institutions and organizations, or historical 

and political factors. The very economic 

transformation of rural areas can also 

marginalize rural populations, in the absence 

of policies to ensure inclusive development. 

Within rural populations, social and cultural 

norms may limit the access of specific 

groups such as youth, women and, in some 

regions, indigenous peoples, to a range of 

productive assets, as well as undermine their 

social status, decision-making power, and 

ability to benefit from public services and 

exercise their citizenship rights. Supporting 

the empowerment of marginalized rural 

people is essential to unleash their enormous 

productive  potential. 

can be made to close them. 8 These draw 

on modern technologies and practices that 

promote input use efficiency and boost 

soil fertility and ecosystem services that 

help build healthy and diverse landscapes. 

They  can additionally be used to access new 

markets, such as those for higher-value crops, 

certified agricultural products or payments 

for ecosystem services, and so create 

new income opportunities. Investments in 

research and development to bring location 

specific solutions for increased productivity – 

building the capacity and skills of farmers and 

community organizations – and good policy 

will drive this process, and determine future 

success or failure. 

Managing and mitigating risk is a prerequisite 

for poor rural households to move, and stay, 

out of poverty, and it is thus central to their 

livelihood strategies. Risk management not 

only strengthens their resilience but also 

increases their ability to seize and benefit from 

opportunities – agricultural and non-farm – 

which generally come with some degree of 

risk. Among policy responses, market -based 

risk management tools for poor rural 

households have gained particular attention 

in recent years. These include a range of 

approaches and products for the delivery of 

financial services in rural areas and contractual 

arrangements within agricultural value chains, 

including: savings and credit, equity financing, 

value chain financing, remittance transfer and 

investment products, and insurance. 

Ensuring that the incentives exist for 

smallholder farmers to increase production 

is a precondition for them to invest more 

of their capital or labour in their production

responsible investment and business in rural 

areas, encourage entrepreneurship, spur 

innovation, and drive increased productivity, 

job creation, and inclusive and sustainable 

rural economic growth. 

Flows of official development assistance (ODA) 

from international development agencies 

comprise a declining and relatively minor 

share of agricultural investment. However, they 

can be important for many least developed 

countries and fragile and conflict-affected 

states, complementing their efforts to mobilize 

domestic public resources. For many more, 

particularly the middle-income countries of 

today and tomorrow with significant and 

persistent poverty and inequality, ODA 

can help catalyse private investment in the 

agricultural and rural sector and support 

governments in strengthening their policies, 

thus deepening and expanding the impact of 

public investment in the sector. 

Beyond these sources, South-South and 

Triangular Cooperation (SSTC) is rapidly 

growing and becoming increasingly important 

for promoting knowledge-sharing and 

investments among developing countries. 

Remittances from migrant workers and 

diaspora investments will also make a major 

contribution to inclusive growth and sustainable 

development in rural areas. Currently, 

international remittances to developing 

countries are estimated at US$435  billion, 

US$200 billion of which (40 per cent) are 

received in rural areas – an amount that is 

expected to reach US$260 billion a year by 

the end of 2017 12  – with the share invested in 

agriculture each year equivalent to four times 

global ODA to agriculture. 

Investment gaps in sustainable agriculture, 

food security and nutrition are difficult 

to quantify. There is general consensus, 

however, that they are huge, with estimates 

## The  new  development  architecture 

## and  financing  landscape 

Prompted in part by the 2007-2008 food 

price crisis, issues relating to food security 

and smallholder agriculture have risen 

up the political and business agendas at 

national and international levels. The  number 

of initiatives established to address  these 

themes has flourished, driven by a variety of 

constituencies. 10  These growing  efforts 11  are 

helping to shape policies and investments 

with a better understanding of opportunities 

and challenges in smallholder agriculture 

and rural development, and of the linkages 

to other global policy concerns, such 

as climate change and inclusive and 

sustainable  development. 

Agenda 2030 and the Addis Ababa Action 

Agenda unequivocally reinforce the call 

for increased attention, cooperation and 

investment in raising the productivity, 

sustainability and resilience of rural livelihoods, 

and agriculture and food systems, with 

special attention to smallholder farmers, 

land-poor and landless workers, women and 

marginalized ethnic groups. Both recognize 

the critical need to strengthen policy 

environments, regulatory frameworks and 

public financing so as to attract increased

## IFAD’s  comparative  advantage 

Established in 1977, IFAD is the only United 

Nations specialized agency and international 

financial institution (IFI) focused exclusively 

on reducing poverty and food insecurity 

in rural areas through agriculture and rural 

development. It has close to 40 years of 

experience contributing to and shaping 

national policies and programmes in this 

domain, providing investment vehicles for 

governments, other development partners 

and a variety of private-sector entities, with 

smallholder farmers, pastoralists, artisanal 

fishers, and other rural people at their centre. 

IFAD is a significant player in the international 

development landscape, and a trusted broker 

of partnerships between governments and 

other stakeholders (e.g. rural communities, 

producers’ organizations, the private sector, 

other donors and international organizations). 

The number and diversity of countries in which 

IFAD works are major assets, enabling it to 

draw on diverse experiences, share lessons 

learned, bring successes from one country 

or region to another – including through 

innovative SSTC approaches – and play 

an important role in shaping global policy 

deliberations that bear on agriculture and 

rural  development. 

of required increases in investments ranging 

from 50 per  cent to more than 100 per cent. 13 

Reviews of investment needs also note glaring 

underinvestment in smallholder agriculture and 

urgent need for strengthened public-private 

partnerships, not only with agribusiness but 

also with smallholder farmers themselves, as 

by far the most important on-farm investors. 

Different countries will require different 

combinations of public and private financing. 

Enabling policy frameworks and public 

finance will be pivotal to delivering catalytic 

public goods and services, paving the 

way for expanded and more equitable 

relations between agribusiness operators 

and smallholder farmers, and reducing risks 

for both sets of parties. Domestic public 

resources should be directed to areas where 

both demand and investment gaps are largest, 

including in productive rural infrastructure 

(irrigation, roads, energy, communication 

networks, storage and markets), climate 

mitigation and adaptation, and other key 

areas such as agricultural research, extension 

and capacity-building. The example of many 

of today’s emerging economies shows that 

significant public spending in agriculture and 

rural development can boost and sustain 

growth and reduce poverty at the same time.

acclaimed promoter of poor rural communities’ 

resilience to climate change, 16  and one of 

the largest lenders supporting inclusive 

rural  finance. 

Its unwavering focus on smallholder 

agriculture and rural development, its 

specialized experience and expertise, and the 

strengths and qualities of its approach give 

it a comparative advantage and strategically 

position it to play a stronger role at national 

and international levels in promoting inclusive 

and sustainable rural transformation and in 

contributing to the SDGs. Going forward, IFAD 

will continue to develop and innovate in its 

areas of comparative advantage and thematic 

focus as defined in this framework and in 

its operational policies and strategies, while 

taking larger strides to ensure that programme 

successes are scaled up for greater impact 

wherever possible. 

IFAD recognizes the comparative advantage 

of others, and that in order to achieve its 

objectives and bring broader benefits to poor 

rural people it must collaborate with partners 

that have complementary areas of expertise 

that go beyond its comparative advantage, 

for example, with respect to macroeconomic 

policy, large scale rural infrastructure, social 

protection, social services, and emergency 

relief. Nevertheless, in some circumstances 

IFAD may finance delivery of social services 

when these are limited in scope and critical to 

the achievement of larger project objectives. 

While IFAD will not provide emergency 

relief in the context of emergencies, it will 

aim to enable affected rural populations to 

recover their economic and social assets, 

in line with the IFAD Guidelines for Disaster 

Early  Recovery. 17 

It has undertaken far-reaching reforms and 

continues to build upon these to strengthen 

the impact of the programmes it supports. 14 

Its operating model comprises robust quality 

assurance during programme design, 

proactive supervision and programme 

implementation support, extensive in-country 

presence, rigorous assessment of programme 

impact, and independent evaluation of 

policies, strategies and operations for 

improved accountability and learning. 15  As  a

result, IFAD-supported programmes show 

steady improvement in terms of both the 

numbers of beneficiaries reached and the 

difference made in their lives. 

IFAD’s main strength lies in building the 

capacity, productivity and market participation 

of rural people using an approach that 

encourages governments and other actors 

to facilitate the economic and social 

empowerment of poor rural people, particularly 

marginalized rural groups such as women and 

indigenous peoples. Development of pro-poor 

agricultural value chains that provide better 

market access for small-scale producers 

and associated micro and small non-farm 

enterprises are major features of IFAD’s 

operations. IFAD is also a recognized leader 

in the field of rural women’s empowerment, 

and is also considered a “global pioneer” 

among United Nations agencies for its work 

in securing indigenous peoples’ rights, an

• Sufficient and affordable nutritious food 

and other agricultural products for a 

growing population; and 

• Enhanced environmental goods 

and  services. 

Guided by this broad transformative vision, 

smallholder agriculture and rural development 

programmes will remain at the heart of 

IFAD’s business: investing in rural people, 

whether they are smallholder farmers 

engaged in crop or livestock production, 

artisanal fishers, or small business operators 

and micro entrepreneurs working in and 

around agricultural value chains. IFAD will 

continue to focus on ensuring that poor rural 

communities and individuals – particularly 

women, indigenous peoples and young 

people – become part of a rural transformation 

that is inclusive and drives overall sustainable 

development. It will also help national and 

local institutions to strengthen their capacity 

to deliver quality services and to develop 

policy environments that foster inclusive and 

sustainable rural transformation. 

Within the broad vision of Agenda 2030, IFAD’s 

strategic vision of inclusive and sustainable 

rural transformation is one in which extreme 

poverty is eliminated; every rural family lives 

in dignity; poor rural people and communities 

are empowered to build prosperous and 

sustainable livelihoods; rural families achieve 

food and nutrition security; young rural people 

can hope to realize their aspirations for a 

better life in their own communities; and where 

rural economies thrive, alleviate pressure on 

natural resources, and are linked to cities – 

supporting and supported by a process of 

sustainable urbanization. 

For IFAD, the objective of “inclusive and 

sustainable rural transformation” is to generate 

improved and more resilient livelihoods for 

all poor rural people, including smallholder 

farmers, land-poor and landless workers, 

women and youth, marginalized ethnic groups, 

and victims of disaster and conflict, while not 

undermining the natural resource base. As a 

process, it is embedded in, contributes to, and 

is driven by national processes of economic 

growth and structural transformation. 

Moreover, for IFAD, inclusive and sustainable 

rural transformation must be driven by a 

smallholder agriculture and rural development 

agenda that delivers the following: 

• Increased social, human and financial 

capital of poor rural people; 

• Strengthened institutions of and for poor 

rural people; 

• Enhanced productivity, profitability, 

resilience, and diversification of poor rural 

people’s economic activities; 

• Greater, and more gainful participation 

of poor rural people in rural, national or 

international economies;

risks; and strengthening the environmental 

sustainability and climate resilience of their 

economic activities. The strategic objectives 

are closely interlinked and mutually reinforcing, 

and therefore, IFAD-financed programmes 

will pursue them in an integrated manner, 

adhering to the principles of engagement, as 

appropriate, based on countries’ and target 

groups’ specific needs and priorities. 

In order to realize the strategic objectives IFAD 

will place special emphasis on a number of 

associated areas of thematic focus. 

(See page 22) 

Outcomes . Reflecting the fact that 

IFAD -supported projects are owned, managed 

and implemented by governments and their 

institutions with other partners, success in 

achieving the impact on rural societies and 

areas embodied in the strategic objectives will 

be determined by the quality of national and 

international policies, in-country capacities 

to manage agriculture and rural development 

programmes, and the level of investments 

flowing to the rural sector. (See page 28) 

Pillars of IFAD’s results delivery . The basis 

for achieving the outcomes, and in turn the 

strategic objectives and overarching goal, 

are the four pillars of IFAD’s results delivery. 

Country programme delivery through COSOPs 

and IFAD’s financial and non-financial 

operations is the direct means by which 

these outcomes are achieved. However, 

ensuring IFAD’s development impact is 

bigger, better and smarter will also require 

mobilization of additional resources; financial 

products that cater to clients’ evolving needs; 

a state -of -the -art knowledge and evidence 

base; proactive engagement in international 

policy processes; and an effective and efficient 

institutional platform. (See page 29)

## A stylized impact pathway 

IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025 – 

summarized in figure 1 below – represents 

the impact pathway through which IFAD 

aims to contribute to the achievement of its 

overarching goal, its strategic vision, and more 

broadly to the SDGs. 

Overarching goal . Over the framework 

period, IFAD’s work will aim to catalyse country 

and global progress towards the following 

overarching goal: rural people overcome poverty 

and achieve food security through remunerative, 

sustainable and resilient livelihoods. 

Principles of engagement . Realization of 

this overarching goal is premised on IFAD’s 

work consistently adhering to five principles of 

engagement. These lie at the core of IFAD’s 

identity, values and institutional DNA and 

cut across the delivery of all its development 

results. IFAD-supported programmes will 

consistently aim to target and benefit the 

largest number of poor rural people possible, 

empower them socially and economically, and 

promote gender equality. IFAD will place a 

premium on innovation, learning and scaling 

up of successes and, in the process, leverage 

effective and efficient partnerships where 

comparative advantages are exploited so that 

the sum of the whole creates greater impact 

than those of its parts. (See page 18) 

Strategic objectives . Based on its mandate, 

comparative advantage, experience, and 

instruments, IFAD will maximize its contribution 

to the framework’s overarching goal by 

concentrating its energy and resources on 

the following strategic objectives: increasing 

poor rural people’s productive capacities in a 

sustainable and resilient manner; increasing 

and improving their engagement in markets, 

while enabling them to better manage related

A key element of its approach is to build 

the capacity of grass roots institutions and 

organizations, 21  or foster their establishment 

where they are non-existent, as a means to 

enable its target group to attain secure access 

to natural resources and production services, 

build their skills and knowledge to take 

advantage of new economic opportunities. In 

so doing, IFAD promotes better governance, 

policies and institutions for agriculture and 

rural development. 

Using improved tools for institutional 

and organizational analysis and capacity 

strengthening, IFAD will intensify its 

assistance to rural institutions and producer 

organizations. It will help them become more 

inclusive and effective in sustainably enhancing 

rural people’s capabilities, and their access to 

the assets, technologies, services and markets 

that are most important for achieving profitable 

farm and non-farm enterprises and effective 

market integration and participation. IFAD will 

also increase its support to rural producers’ 

organizations in representing the interests 

of their members and constituents, and in 

contributing to relevant policy and governance 

debates and processes. 22 

Gender equality . Guided by its Policy 

on Gender Equality and Women’s 

Empowerment, 23  IFAD will consolidate its 

position as a leading agency on innovative 

measures to promote rural women’s 

empowerment. The Fund will promote 

economic empowerment that enables rural 

women and men to have an equal opportunity 

to participate in, and benefit from, the activities 

that it finances. This will be complemented 

by efforts to reduce the labour burden of 

rural women and increase their voice in 

decision -making at all levels. IFAD will look 

## Principles of engagement 

Targeting . Agenda 2030 is epitomized by the 

commitment to leave no one behind. In this 

spirit, and in line with its targeting policy, 18 

IFAD will use a variety of tools to ensure that 

the largest possible number of poor rural 

people benefit from emerging economic 

opportunities, and that those who cannot 

do so immediately – notably people from 

marginalized groups, in particular women, 

indigenous peoples 19  and young people – 

are proactively supported in developing the 

skills and assets to do so in the near future. 

The  Fund will pursue the identification of its 

target group in a participatory way working 

with partners to “identify the target groups 

through a gender-sensitive poverty and 

livelihood analysis using available data, filling 

information gaps as needed, and always 

incorporating the views of poor women and 

men and their  organizations”. 

Empowerment . IFAD has long recognized 

the critical importance of social and economic 

empowerment of rural people living in 

poverty, both individually and collectively, 

and promoted policies and investments that 

enhance their capabilities and livelihoods. 20

IFAD has long championed the cause of  indigenous peoples , and responded to 

their needs and priorities through its investment programmes, a dedicated facility (the 

Indigenous Peoples Assistance Facility), and the Indigenous Peoples Forum at IFAD, 

a dialogue process whose global meetings IFAD convenes every two years. Based 

on its Policy on Engagement with Indigenous Peoples, IFAD supports their self-driven 

development, while respecting and enhancing their traditional livelihoods, occupations 

and knowledge. IFAD’s interventions, and their targeting will be improved, including 

through more in-depth socio-cultural and vulnerability analyses of different target 

groups and by integrating specific indicators on their well-being to capture impacts 

and results. 

Investing in and harnessing the potential of  rural youth  will be essential to sustain 

dynamic rural economic growth in the future, making them a priority group for 

IFAD. Increasing attention to rural youth, particularly in countries where strong 

rural population growth is projected, will also be important to mitigate pressure 

on land, natural resources and labour markets, and stem unmanageable patterns 

of rural-urban migration. In promoting youth-sensitive development, IFAD will 

more consistently incorporate the needs and aspirations of young people into its 

operations, and pay closer attention to identifying and creating rural employment and 

enterprise options appropriate to them, in both the farm and the non-farm sector. 20 

Partnerships . Agenda 2030 brings the critical 

importance of partnerships – both global and 

within countries – into sharp relief. 24  IFAD fully 

recognizes this reality, given the magnitude of 

the agenda and the investments required for 

smallholder agriculture development and rural 

transformation. Partnerships will be crucial 

for IFAD to promote synergies among its own 

and other sources of finance, knowledge 

and expertise and create more enabling 

environments for poor people in rural areas to 

build their pathways out of poverty. 

IFAD will engage with a broad range of 

partners: Member States, development 

institutions, farmer organizations, the private 

sector, foundations, and other relevant 

national and international stakeholders. It will 

strengthen successful existing partnerships 

and develop new ones especially with partners 

with complementary areas of expertise 

that go beyond its comparative advantage. 

It  will continue its strong engagement with 

the international development community 

to build support around relevant global 

issues affecting rural communities, and 

facilitate multistakeholder partnerships 

between governments, the private sector 

and small -scale rural producers, including 

increasingly through SSTC. 

For this continuum of innovation -learning -scaling 

up to work effectively, IFAD-supported 

programmes must be structured to: 

• Offer opportunities to innovate in 

a range of ways that respond to 

the specific challenges faced by 

programme  beneficiaries; 

• Build new forms of partnerships with 

local communities, organizations of rural 

people, the private sector and other 

development partners that can bring to 

bear substantial financial resources, new 

approaches to rural development, and 

strong technical expertise; and 

• Have effective monitoring and evaluation 

(M&E) and knowledge management 

systems in place at programme 

initiation that allow testing of innovative 

approaches, measurement of results and 

impact, and analysis of drivers of success, 

in order to generate lessons and evidence 

to shape policies, institutions and 

practices for expanded impact in terms of 

rural poverty and hunger reduction. 

During the framework period IFAD will continue 

to institutionalize a systematic approach to 

operationalizing this agenda through iteratively 

improved business processes, financial 

instruments and incentives.

ownership of IFAD-supported programmes. 

Yet, the success of these programmes very 

much relies on collaboration with other 

development partners, research institutions, 

the private sector and civil society, rural 

communities and their organizations. In this 

context, a key priority for IFAD will be the 

promotion of closer collaboration at local 

and country level between private-sector 

actors, financial institutions, and producers’ 

organizations and cooperatives to catalyse 

investments and employment in rural 

areas while reinforcing the inclusiveness of 

market -driven smallholder development. 

For this purpose it will consolidate and 

expand the use of multi stakeholder 

approaches such as the recently 

articulated public -private -producer (4Ps) 

partnership  mechanism. 

Collaboration among the Rome-based 

agencies (RBAs) will be of strategic priority. 

Their proximity and similar overarching goals, 

yet differentiated mandates and instruments, 

present a unique opportunity to reinvigorate 

their joint efforts to support realization of 

SDG2. The partnership between the RBAs 

will leverage IFAD’s own comparative 

advantage in providing long-term financial 

investment for smallholder agriculture and rural 

transformation, the unique strength of FAO in 

technical and global policy issues for food and 

agriculture, and the unmatched capabilities 

of WFP in providing timely support to 

countries during acute humanitarian disasters. 

Strengthened partnership with multilateral 

development banks (MDBs) will also be a 

priority, including through more systematic 

knowledge generation and sharing, joint 

advocacy for pro-poor inclusive policies and 

investments, and expanded cofinancing. 

In IFAD’s business model, partnerships and 

policy engagement with governments are 

the basis for the formulation and country 

Through the  public-private-producer partnerships (4Ps) mechanism  IFAD 

seeks to build mutually beneficial partnerships between the public sector, the private 

sector and small-scale rural producers. The mechanism uses investments in public 

goods and a supportive policy framework to stimulate and scale up responsible 

private investments in food and agriculture value chains, benefitting smallholder 

farmers by giving them access to secure markets, technology and services, and 

other rural people by creating off-farm jobs along value chains and across the larger 

rural  economy. 22 

Based on its Policy on Improving Access 

to Land and Tenure Security, 25  and through 

strategic partnerships such as the one with 

the International Land Coalition (ILC), 26  IFAD 

will promote secure tenure and equitable 

rights to, and governance of, land, territories 

and water, by designing programmes that 

directly address issues of access and tenure 

and promoting policies at the national and 

international levels that establish secure 

resource access as a central tenet of rural 

transformation. Through training and policy 

engagement, IFAD will strengthen the capacity 

of country partners to implement the Voluntary 

Guidelines on the Responsible Governance 

of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests. 

Furthermore, IFAD-supported programmes 

will also help rural people manage natural 

resources more efficiently and sustainably, 

enhancing their resilience to resource scarcity 

and degradation, and to climate change (as 

further discussed under strategic objective 3). 

Access to agricultural technologies 

and production services . Meeting the 

growing demand for healthy foods and other 

agricultural products in coming decades will 

require sustainable intensification of agricultural 

production to raise yields (as well as nutrient 

value) of crops, livestock products and fish. 

In many cases, this will entail the widespread 

adoption of improved agricultural technologies 

that increase returns on labour and enable 

smallholder farmers to be more productive 

without compromising the efficient and 

sustainable use of natural resources (work in 

this area will be reinforced through strategic 

objective 3). 

In future programme design, increased focus 

will be placed on the targeted introduction 

of modern inputs, combined with good 

agricultural practices, to spur significant 

improvement in smallholder agriculture 

productivity. This will be complemented by 

continued strong support for investment in 

pro-poor agricultural research that brings 

concrete benefits to smallholder farmers, to 

be advanced principally through IFAD’s grants 

## Strategic  objectives 

SO1: Increase poor rural people’s 

productive capacities 

Investing in rural people, in particular those 

most vulnerable, to enhance their access 

and control over assets and resources, help 

them obtain the goods and services they 

need, and improve their skills to become more 

productive small-scale agricultural or non-farm 

entrepreneurs, is central to IFAD’s mandate. 

IFAD will continue to give pride of place to 

capacity- and asset-building for poor rural 

people through the programmes it supports 

and its complementary policy engagement to 

enable them to realize their full potential. 

Areas of thematic focus 

Access to natural resources . For poor rural 

people, lack of access to natural resources 

– agricultural land for crop production, 

water for irrigation, and common property 

resources (forests, rangeland, water sources, 

fisheries resources) – is a critical constraint. 

Improving  access, security and transferability 

of natural resources increases the value of 

household assets, generates higher levels of 

investment and agricultural productivity, and 

facilitates access to credit. Furthermore, the 

better defined and more secure the tenure or 

use rights, the more likely that those resources 

are sustainably managed.

institutions, insurance companies, money 

transfer operators, cellular phone companies, 

and leasing and equity companies. Work in 

this area is guided by the IFAD Rural Finance 

Policy 27  and supported by mechanisms such 

as the IFAD Financing Facility for Remittances, 

which aims to leverage remittances flows as 

a basis for financial inclusion and productive 

rural investments. 

IFAD will continue to support innovative 

financial instruments, such as weather 

index -based insurance, to increase the ability 

to cope with risk at the household level. 

IFAD will also continue to work through the 

multi-donor Platform for Agricultural Risk 

Management initiative, hosted by IFAD, to 

promote risk management capacity for the 

agricultural sector in developing countries. 

Nutrition . Strengthening the productive 

potential of rural people also entails improving 

their physical and intellectual capacities. 

Nutrition plays an important part in this 

regard, leading – through better health – to 

greater lifetime earnings and resilience of rural 

households. Agricultural productivity growth 

alone is not sufficient to generate improved 

nutritional outcomes. Guided by its Action 

Plan on Mainstreaming Nutrition-Sensitive 

Agriculture, IFAD’s country programmes 

and projects will systematically promote the 

availability, accessibility, affordability and 

consumption of diverse, nutritious foods 

(including biofortified crops with higher nutrient 

value). To ensure the connection between 

increased incomes and production and better 

nutrition, IFAD’s programmes will also work to 

raise nutrition knowledge and education and 

seek to improve practices and behaviours 

that lead to year-round healthy diets for all 

household members, including those dealing 

with food choices, and food quality, storage, 

preservation and preparation. 

programme and in collaboration with a wide 

range of partners, national and international, 

in  the agricultural research realm. 

Expanding the uptake of new information 

communication technologies will be a priority. 

IFAD will leverage the surge in cellular phone 

ownership to facilitate access to better 

market information and financial services 

and products such as credit, savings and 

insurance, as well as to weather information 

to ensure better capacity to predict rainfall 

and better preparedness for extreme weather 

events. Through closer collaboration with 

other development partners, it will strengthen 

the capacity of smallholder farmers and other 

rural people through technical, vocational 

and managerial skills development and the 

provision of business advisory services. 

Inclusive financial services . Inadequate 

access to appropriate financial services 

is a key factor underlying rural poverty; 

it  perpetuates rural people’s economic and 

social exclusion and greatly curtails their ability 

to expand their assets and sustainably engage 

in productive activities. IFAD will continue to 

support rural finance with the overall aim of 

expanding and deepening the access of rural 

people to financial services, and increasing the 

outreach, competitiveness, cost-effectiveness, 

and sustainability of rural financial institutions. 

At the macro level, IFAD will focus on 

improving the policy environment governing 

rural finance systems by supporting the 

strengthening of legal, regulatory and 

supervisory frameworks so as to facilitate 

rural finance and development. At the meso 

level, it will work to develop efficient support 

infrastructure for the rural financial sector 

by building both human and institutional 

capacity, such as through credit reference 

bureaux, collateral registries, mobile payment 

platforms and training and certification 

institutes for rural financial service providers, 

remittance payments systems and postal 

networks. At the micro level, it will expand 

outreach and development of new products 

and services offered by banks, microfinance  27  IFAD Rural Finance Policy: www.ifad.org/gbdocs/eb/96/e/ 

> EB -2009-96-R-2-Rev-1.pdf. 24

Areas of thematic focus 

Diversified rural enterprise and employment 

opportunities . IFAD has long recognized the 

importance of supporting the complementary 

development of agricultural and non-farm 

activities. It has demonstrated this more 

systematically in recent years, through a 

prominent shift within its operations towards 

the development of local value chains and 

vocational education and apprenticeships. 

Guided by its Private-Sector Strategy 29  and 

Rural Enterprise Policy, 30  IFAD works to 

strengthen mutually beneficial partnerships 

between the public sector, the private sector 

and small rural producers. IFAD seeks to 

leverage private- and public-sector investment 

to create new markets for smallholder farmers’ 

produce and for other rural people in related 

services such as input provision, processing, 

marketing, transportation, or equipment 

supply and maintenance. Of course, the 

support for inclusive rural finance and access 

to agricultural technology and production 

services noted under strategic objective 1 will 

also be critical for diversifying rural enterprises 

and employment opportunities. 

Going forward, IFAD will continue to build 

on its experience and that of others with 

a comparative advantage in micro-, small 

and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) and 

value chain development in order to scale up 

successful contractual arrangements, value 

chain business models and multistakeholder 

approaches such as the 4Ps mechanism. 

It will also explore alternative financial and 

non-financial instruments to support rural 

MSME growth, including remittances-backed 

investments funds and diaspora investment. 

IFAD will support value chain actors and their 

financial institutions to develop and use more 

sophisticated value chain financing instruments 

such as warehouse receipt systems, leasing, 

equity financing and guarantee fund schemes. 

IFAD also recognizes the multisectoral nature 

of the causes of malnutrition. Consequently, 

its approach will be to optimize the 

complementary contributions that food and 

agriculture can make to improve nutrition, 

including by engaging with partners with 

expertise in other sectors, particularly health, 

education and water and sanitation. A focus 

on women is also important given their major 

roles in food production and marketing, and 

caring for the household, which are significant 

factors in nutrition outcomes. 

SO2: Increase poor rural people’s benefits 

from market participation 

Improving the engagement of poor rural 

people in markets for goods, services and 

wage labour – both in agriculture and in 

non-farm activities – that provide them with 

enhanced, predictable and stable incomes is 

essential for rural poverty reduction. Building or 

expanding agricultural value chains, reducing 

risk and transaction costs along them, 

improving the terms on which smallholder 

farmers participate in them, and creating 

employment along the value chain, are all 

features of IFAD’s approach. 28  Improvements in 

farm-to-market roads, better storage facilities 

and wholesale market places will encourage 

farmers to invest in better production 

technologies, and private companies to source 

more products from smallholder farmers. 

Influencing public policies and strengthening 

institutions and organizations in the rural 

landscape that improve the terms of poor 

people’s engagement with markets will 

be  fundamental.

> EB-2003-78-R-14.pdf. 25

Rural producers’ organizations . Given 

the limited scale of smallholder farmers’ 

enterprises and the transaction costs 

associated with engaging in high-value 

markets, bringing them together into 

organizations and bulking their products 

often facilitates access to markets, and is 

indeed critical to the long term viability of their 

integration in value chains. IFAD will assist 

farmers’ organizations in achieving economies 

of scale for procuring inputs, technologies 

and services; reducing produce collection and 

transaction costs; enhancing value added 

through processing and better handling/ 

storage; and overcoming asymmetrical 

relationships in value chains. IFAD will continue 

to actively promote the capacity of farmers’ 

organizations to take part in policy, institutional 

and programming processes at the local, 

national and international level that affect 

agriculture and rural economies. 

Rural infrastructure . In rural areas of many 

countries, infrastructure remains woefully 

inadequate. This results in underinvestment 

in agricultural production, agricultural supply 

chains and related production services. 

It undermines rural peoples’ ability to reach 

their productive potential and to access 

and effectively participate in markets. While 

closing these gaps in rural areas is often 

an expensive long-term proposition, these 

investments have enormous potential to boost 

production, reduce transport and transaction 

costs, improve the competitiveness of 

poor rural producers, create rural-urban 

synergies, offer rural people and their 

communities more remunerative, diversified 

and resilient livelihoods, and spur growth in 

rural  economies. 

And it will support rural people’s engagement 

in environmental services markets where these 

offer promising opportunities for improved 

livelihoods. At all times, IFAD will promote 

responsible business practices in line with 

the Principles for Responsible Investment in 

Agriculture and Food Systems approved by 

the Committee on World Food Security, as 

well as the principles advocated by the United 

Nations Global Compact. 

Rural investment environment . Shaping 

environments where rural MSMEs can 

thrive and larger numbers of small-scale 

producers and rural people can sustainably 

and profitably engage with their businesses 

(through value chains, job creation or service 

provision) will be an important focus of 

IFAD’s policy engagement efforts at country 

and international levels. In this context, 

IFAD country programmes will increasingly 

include policy engagement to improve 

rural investment environments as part of 

their specific objectives, and facilitate multi 

stakeholder platforms in which all actors, 

including from the private sector, discuss and 

agree on the key issues involved in improving 

the investment climate for small-scale rural 

producers and other rural entrepreneurs. 

Working with a variety of partners, IFAD will 

support governments to develop policy, 

legal and regulatory frameworks and 

relevant institutions that foster competitive, 

transparent and dynamic domestic markets 

offering remunerative, stable and predictable 

prices for IFAD’s target group, and promote 

broad -based improvement in other conditions 

(discussed under strategic objectives 1 and 3) 

that will enable their success in these markets 

over the  long-term. 26 

thereby improving their resilience. In working in 

these thematic areas, IFAD will base projects 

and policies on a deeper risk assessment and 

a better understanding of the interconnections 

between smallholder farming, rural economic 

activity and the wider landscape. 

In this context special attention needs to 

be paid to environmental sustainability and 

climate resilience in agriculture while also 

promoting a reduction of greenhouse gas 

emissions from agriculture and agrifood 

value chains, and harnessing under utilized 

synergies that exist between adaptation 

and mitigation. IFAD’s work in this area will 

be guided by its Environment and Natural 

Resource Management Policy, 31  Climate 

Change Strategy, 32  the 10-point Climate 

Mainstreaming Plan, 33  and the Social, 

Environmental and Climate Assessment 

Procedures (SECAP). 34 

Areas of thematic focus 

Environmental sustainability . IFAD will 

expand its support for the development, 

dissemination and uptake of improved 

agricultural technologies and practices that 

raise the productivity, sustainability and 

resilience of smallholder production systems. 

Its interventions will focus on addressing four 

main sources of threat: resource degradation, 

pollution, loss of habitat and biodiversity, 

and natural hazards. In this vein, IFAD will 

pursue “multiple-benefit” approaches that 

simultaneously enhance biodiversity, increase 

agricultural productivity and lower greenhouse 

gas emissions from the agriculture sector while 

contributing to poverty reduction. 

In this regard, IFAD’s focus, in collaboration 

with public and private partners, will be on 

improving and effectively managing basic 

infrastructure linked to rural production 

systems: constructing or rehabilitating 

irrigation and water management systems, 

tertiary roads, local energy generation, and 

upgrading of storage facilities and warehouses 

(critical to reducing post-harvest losses, 

mitigating the incidence and impact of local 

food price volatility, and decreasing pressure 

for more food production). For large-scale rural 

infrastructure development, IFAD will partner 

with the public sector and other donors who 

will provide the bulk of investment, with IFAD 

focusing on complementary projects to ensure 

that smallholder farmers and other poor rural 

people are able to take advantage of the 

opportunities presented by these investments. 

SO3: Strengthen the environmental 

sustainability and climate resilience of 

poor rural people’s economic activities 

Rural livelihoods are affected by a variety of 

risks and shocks, resulting from, inter alia, 

environmental factors and climate change, 

market and policy failures, and conflict. 

Making sustainable progress in building 

the asset base, capabilities, and market 

opportunities for poor rural people requires 

that risks and shocks are addressed in a 

comprehensive manner, thereby building 

resilience in rural people’s livelihoods. Many  of 

the thematic areas noted under strategic 

objectives 1 and 2 will expand or improve the 

asset base of poor rural households and allow 

them to diversify their activities to mitigate risk

• Better analysis of environmental and 

climatic risks in value chains to ensure 

sustainability of the selected commodities 

and understand their current and potential 

impact on natural resources; 

• Enhanced climate resilience by promoting 

diversification as a risk management 

strategy to enhance farmers’ livelihoods, 

including through specific interventions 

such as production and marketing of 

indigenous crops that are drought -resistant 

and enable low-input farming; 

• Affordable risk management strategies 

and safety nets, such as weather index 

based insurance, to help rural people 

improve their financial security and protect 

their livelihoods in the event of extreme 

weather events and natural disasters. 

Improved sustainability of project outcomes 

will be underpinned by the application of 

the Social, Environmental and Climate 

Assessment Procedures (SECAP), which 

set out a minimum risk assessment process 

that recognizes the necessary heterogeneity 

of IFAD investment responses given 

widely different country and community 

circumstances, and further mitigate the risk 

of IFAD programmes causing environmental 

or social harm. Climate risk screening will 

be integrated into the quality enhancement 

process for all projects and COSOPs. 

In order to successfully deliver on this 

strategic objective, IFAD will increase its role 

in managing climate finance. Drawing on the 

success of the ASAP IFAD will use diverse 

funding channels to cover the additional cost 

of climate mainstreaming, including through 

multilateral funding sources such as the Green 

Climate Fund, Global Environment Facility 

(GEF), Least Developed Countries Fund 

(LDCF), Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) 

and bilateral cofinancing. 

IFAD will continue to place strong emphasis 

on facilitating the restoration and sustainable 

management and use of ecosystems and 

their services in projects and through policy 

engagement and partnership-building. 

Its programmes will develop capacities and 

incentives for rural people to become better 

stewards of natural resources by fostering 

creation of environmental service markets for 

carbon sequestration, watershed management 

and safeguarding biodiversity. Support will 

also be provided to bring forest areas under 

improved forms of participatory management, 

along with assistance to initiatives certifying 

forests as sustainably managed. Collaboration 

with and engagement of indigenous peoples’ 

communities in the provision of environmental 

services that are sensitive to their traditional 

knowledge and culture will be an area of 

focus in this regard, in order to enhance the 

resilience of the ecosystems in which they live. 

Climate change . Over the framework period, 

IFAD’s objective is to reach 100 per cent 

climate mainstreaming, making it arguably 

one of the most advanced IFIs on climate 

integration. Through its Adaptation for 

Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP) 

IFAD will continue to expand the promotion of 

climate-resilient agricultural practices, and in 

so doing, also enhance its contribution to the 

realization of carbon sequestration benefits. In 

this context, increased attention will be given 

to the following: 

• Better analysis of climate risks and 

vulnerabilities using state-of-the-art 

technologies including those related to 

earth observation, climate modelling, 

geographic information systems and early 

warning systems; 

• Greater recognition and improved 

analysis of the specific climatic risks 

faced by individual countries such as 

weather -related disasters, sea-level rise 

and reduced agricultural productivity; 28 

borrowing; its country programmes, which 

will be specifically designed as collaborative 

scaling-up devices to attract additional 

resources from public, private, domestic and 

international sources; and the creation of new 

mechanisms for investment through IFAD 

itself, including innovative lending facilities and 

thematic multi-donor trust funds. 

Improved country-level capacity for rural 

policy and programme development, 

implementation and evaluation 

In line with aid effectiveness principles 

and given that the country programmes 

IFAD supports are nationally executed, 

strengthening the capacity of national 

stakeholders (government agencies in 

particular, but also non-governmental 

organizations (NGOs), private-sector service 

providers, or organizations of poor rural 

people) to formulate, manage, implement and 

evaluate national policies and programmes for 

smallholder agriculture and rural development 

is critical. An important element of IFAD’s 

work with government institutions will be to 

promote transparency, responsiveness and 

accountability in the planning, financing and 

provision of public-sector services. IFAD may 

also assist governments in redefining the 

role and the core functions of public -sector 

institutions for agriculture and rural 

development and promote an environment 

of learning through careful evaluation of 

programmes. IFAD will further support 

government efforts to develop an enabling 

institutional framework for poor rural people to 

organize into groups or associations, and to 

create space for a dialogue with them on key 

rural issues. 

## Outcomes 

Enabling policy and regulatory 

frameworks at national and 

international  levels 

IFAD’s aim is for national and international 

level policy and regulatory frameworks that 

effectively support smallholder agriculture 

and rural development to be in place and 

used to their full potential. IFAD will engage 

with relevant stakeholders – national 

and sub -national governments, farmers’ 

organizations, civil society, the private sector 

and other development partners, including 

organizations promoting regional cooperation 

– to enhance policy frameworks or strengthen 

their implementation and resourcing. 

In  supporting policy and regulatory reform 

and innovation, IFAD will promote a focus 

on issues relevant to its strategic objectives 

and areas of thematic focus defined above 

and promote stronger representation of the 

interests of the rural poor and their own 

organizations, taking into account the policy 

and institutional lessons that it and its partners 

have learned. 

Increased levels of investment in the 

rural  sector 

As indicated above on page 12, current 

levels of investment in the rural sector are 

grossly inadequate relative to requirements. 

Indeed, the enormous investment needs in the 

areas of agriculture and rural development, 

and their critical role in achieving the 

SDGs, are unequivocally highlighted in the 

Addis Ababa Action Agenda. In addition to 

general advocacy for greater commitment 

of resources, IFAD will provide for increased 

investment in the rural sector through its 

replenishment mechanism combined with 29 

capacity, and that project budgets correspond 

to best estimates for major expenditures. 

Supervision and implementation support will 

be strengthened, including as a result of the 

extension of IFAD’s country presence and of 

operating in a more decentralized manner, 

and through more proactive monitoring 

and follow -up of projects at risk. Greater 

emphasis will also be placed on improving the 

use of data and lessons from M&E systems 

to enhance project implementation on an 

ongoing basis. 

Targeted and tailored country approaches .

Recognizing that challenges and opportunities 

vary considerably across countries, IFAD 

adopts approaches that are tailored and 

targeted according to country context. As a 

principle, its approach to programme design 

is to align interventions with the stated needs 

and strategies of its partner countries and its 

own policies. Nevertheless, IFAD has learned 

important lessons from its operations in fragile 

and conflict-affected states and situations, 

low-income countries (LICs), middle-income 

countries (MICs), and Small Island Developing 

States (SIDS), which will shape the broad 

direction of future engagements with them. 

In fragile and conflict-affected states and 

situations, IFAD’s programmes will be 

designed with more realistic objectives, in line 

with local implementation capacities. Focus 

will be on strengthening partnerships with, and 

developing the capacities of, NGOs and civil 

society organizations, with particular attention 

to building the resilience of community-level 

organizations to shocks; and support to overall 

institutional capacity development. 36 

## Pillars  of  IFAD’s  results  delivery 

Country programme delivery 

COSOPs are the core instrument for 

planning, managing and monitoring the full 

array of IFAD’s financial (loans and grants) 

and non-financial (knowledge management, 

partnership-building and policy engagement) 

operations at the country level – supporting 

national development priorities and in 

coordination with a range of partners. 35 

While investment projects will remain critical 

in catalysing valuable public and private 

financing for the agricultural and rural sector, 

IFAD country programmes will increasingly 

seek to expand their development impact by 

supporting a strengthening of national policy 

frameworks (for this, country-level policy 

engagement plans will be a requirement for 

all COSOPs). Within the broader context of 

its scaling up agenda, a key part of their role 

will be to generate evidence on the impact 

of policies and programmes with a view 

to supporting national stakeholder efforts 

to strengthen them and the associated 

investments that support their implementation. 

A key dimension of COSOPs will be to identify 

how project investments, grant-financed 

activities and policy engagement can most 

effectively combine to achieve agreed 

strategic  objectives. 

Programme design and implementation 

support.  Simplification, implementation 

readiness and realism in the design of 

IFAD’s programmes and projects will be 

fundamental to their success. Since  the 

advent of direct supervision in 2006, 

experience has demonstrated that limiting the 

number of components, activity areas and 

implementation agencies have been important 

factors in improved project outcomes. 

IFAD will stress the implementation readiness 

of projects to minimize delays at start-up, 

a recurring factor in underperformance. 

Additional focus will be placed on realism of 

design so that project outcomes are clearly 

achievable, given existing implementation

partnerships, resource mobilization and policy 

engagement; more systematic analysis and 

sharing of country programme knowledge; 

enhanced capacities of decentralized staff; 

and streamlined business processes. 

IFAD will optimize efficiency and 

complementarity of functions, service delivery 

and knowledge flows between ICOs and 

headquarters, ensuring a more country-based 

approach to the provision of day-to-day 

programme support. Layers of approval will be 

reduced and the accountability and delegated 

authority of decentralized offices enhanced. 

Once fully established, ICOs will serve 

approximately 70 per cent of the total number 

of IFAD-funded projects and will absorb over 

80 per cent of IFAD’s total financing. Future 

locations and models of decentralization will 

follow criteria established by IFAD’s Executive 

Board, with particular attention to country 

programme size and country circumstances, 

and cost-effectiveness. 

Knowledge building, dissemination and 

policy engagement 

Knowledge management processes 

and products . IFAD recognizes that a core 

purpose of its knowledge management 

efforts must be to identify, develop and 

promote successful and innovative 

approaches and interventions that have 

demonstrated potential to be scaled up. 

As  such, building a comprehensive evidence 

base of development solutions for the rural 

sector and strengthening IFAD’s capacity to 

more effectively bring these to bear in policy 

processes at country, regional and global 

levels will be key priorities. This agenda will 

involve deeper analysis of results and lessons 

from operations; systematic production of data 

and evidence of effectiveness; more proactive 

mobilization of knowledge from partners; and 

a strategic approach to internal and external 

knowledge -sharing and communication 

that assembles and compellingly conveys 

knowledge and evidence tailored to specific 

needs of different audiences. 

IFAD will play an important role in supporting 

MICs to reduce rural poverty given its mandate 

and the significant number of rural poor 

in such countries. An increasing number 

of IFAD’s developing Member States are 

reaching MIC status and borrowing on blend 

and ordinary terms, and IFAD’s financing 

model has to adapt to this changing reality. 

IFAD’s engagement will focus on helping 

governments address issues of rural-urban 

inequality, uneven rural-urban growth, 

and youth unemployment by supporting 

enhancement of pro-rural poor policies, 

strategies, programmes and institutions. 

Its engagement will consist of lending and 

non-lending activities, with a wide offering of 

knowledge management, policy development 

and SSTC services, including reimbursable 

technical assistance programmes for MICs 

that seek only technical support. IFAD will 

develop increasingly differentiated approaches 

for, and among, MICs and for countries in 

fragile situations. The IFAD10 commitment to 

provide updated information on IFAD’s strategy 

on engagement with MICs to the Executive 

Board will be met in April 2016 following 

completion of the corporate-level evaluation 

of IFAD’s performance-based allocation 

system  by IOE. 

IFAD recognizes the specific challenges and 

vulnerabilities facing SIDS. Its approach for 

these countries will focus on three thematic 

areas: sustainable small scale fisheries and 

aquaculture; opportunities and employment for 

smallholder agriculture; and environment and 

climate change. 

IFAD’s decentralization . Increased proximity 

to clients and partners is pivotal to enable 

IFAD to fully realize the desired impact of the 

operations it supports. Gains from expanded 

and improved decentralization and client 

focus will be realized through six medium  term 

objectives: establishment of additional 

IFAD country offices (ICOs); improved 

portfolio performance through supervision 

and implementation support; increased 31 

innovations, technologies, methodologies and 

lessons between policymakers, development 

practitioners and the private sector. IFAD  plans 

to strengthen its comparative advantage 

and expand its work in this area in terms 

of both knowledge-based cooperation and 

investment promotion, seeing it as an integral 

part of its business model and of its country 

programming process. 

Global policy engagement . IFAD’s impact 

on the ground is strongly affected by 

developments at the global level – to which 

it also contributes. The design of Agenda 

2030 is just one example of this realization, 

complementing other parallel and interrelated 

processes of convergence around a global 

agenda for financing for development and 

climate change. Going forward, IFAD will 

seize opportunities to bring its operational 

knowledge to these and other international 

policy processes of strategic relevance for 

IFAD. 37  It will aim, in particular, to: (i) position 

inclusive and sustainable rural transformation 

as a key part of the implementation, financing, 

and monitoring of Agenda 2030; (ii) promote 

enabling policy changes around key drivers 

affecting inclusive and sustainable rural 

transformation, with an emphasis on reforms 

and innovations that enhance scope for 

greater and more effective investments in 

rural areas; (iii) create space for, and support, 

the concerns and voices of rural people in 

international policy processes; (iv) advocate for 

more effective mobilization and leveraging of 

international and domestic financing flows for 

inclusive rural investments; and (v) expand and 

deepen both its internal communications and 

strategic external communications to advance 

these aims. 

Key knowledge management instruments 

and products will include the revamped 

IFAD grants programme (guided by the 

2015 IFAD Policy for Grant Financing), the 

establishment of a corporate knowledge and 

research agenda, and the launch of a strategic 

publications programme. Broader publications 

such as the flagship Rural Development 

Report, and derivative research and policy 

products, will be released with greater 

frequency, and a new periodic report on rural 

policy reforms and investment priorities will be 

launched. IFAD recognizes the critical role of 

communication of results and lessons in ways 

that will inspire support from policymakers 

and other key stakeholders, and will increase 

its investments in this area with a focus on 

high -quality strategic communications. 

Impact measurement . IFAD’s aim to build 

evidenced-based knowledge that improves 

country-level results rests upon rigorous 

measurement of project impact. To this 

end, IFAD will implement a multi-pronged 

strategy that moves beyond the current focus 

on its Results and Impact Measurement 

System (RIMS). Quantitative and qualitative 

approaches will be used as appropriate, 

focusing on attributing impact to projects 

and designed to learn lessons that can 

influence project design and country policy 

engagement. Cutting-edge impact evaluation 

methods, including experimental and 

non -experimental approaches, will be used 

and fully embedded into project designs. There 

will be a greater focus on facilitating learning 

from impact evaluations performed by IOE as 

well as relevant impact evaluations performed 

by outside institutions. 

South-South and Triangular Cooperation .

As a global institution IFAD will promote 

SSTC as a key mechanism for delivering 

relevant, targeted and cost-effective 

development solutions to partners across 

the globe. It will play a more significant 

role as a knowledge -broker for SSTC by 

facilitating opportunities for sharing relevant

Mobilization (ARM) Initiative, IFAD will continue 

to pursue complementary financing channels 

such as supplementary funds, cofinancing 

and borrowing (in line with the Sovereign 

Borrowing Framework established in 2015). 39 

Capitalizing on its expertise and experience 

as an IFI, IFAD will consolidate its position 

as a reliable manager of funds supporting 

rural development. In consultation with and 

as agreed by the Executive Board, IFAD will 

explore the feasibility and scope for borrowing 

from the market. 

Financial products . With a view to better 

respond to its clients’ needs and demands, 

IFAD will seek to diversify and tailor the 

financial products it offers to partner countries 

and enhance its role as a catalyst for increased 

public and private investment in the rural 

sector. In this context, it will assess the viability 

of products used by other IFIs, such as: 

• Direct equity investments: by effecting 

limited direct investments in projects or 

enterprises, IFAD can achieve the dual 

objective of monitoring them very closely 

and acting as a catalyst for much larger 

private-sector investments; and 

• Provision of credit guarantees: possibly in 

cooperation with other IFIs who already 

offer this financial product, IFAD may 

develop this capability in order to facilitate 

smallholder farmers and SMEs’ access 

to  credit. 

Cofinancing . Domestic and international 

cofinancing by public and private partners 

is critical for expanding the impact of IFAD’s 

programme of work. Significant opportunities 

for increased cofinancing will arise from 

partnering with domestic financiers, especially 

in middle-income countries, from bilateral and 

multilateral development banks, and from 

international institutions providing climate 

financing. The latter is rapidly growing in terms 

of actual and potential flows, and IFAD is 

already committed to playing a stronger role 

in mobilizing funds to address climate change 

from the GEF, LDCF, SCCF and the newly 

established Green Climate Fund. 

Financial capacity and instruments 

Achieving inclusive and sustainable rural 

transformation and fulfilling the ambitious SDG 

targets will require mobilization of substantially 

greater resources within a rapidly changing 

development financing landscape. In full 

adherence with the Agreement Establishing 

IFAD, access to IFAD’s resources in terms 

of level and conditions will take into account 

IFAD’s evolving financing model and objective 

economic and social criteria of IFAD recipient 

countries. IFAD will continue to develop a 

stronger, more innovative and efficient financial 

complex, allowing it to play its role as an 

agency of the United Nations and an IFI to 

the  full. 38 

Resource mobilization . IFAD will aim to 

achieve robust growth in its programme of 

loans and grants over the next 10 years. 

Resource mobilization efforts will continue 

to focus on strategic partners, public and 

private, with whom IFAD can realize the 

highest possible return on investments in 

agriculture and rural development. IFAD is well 

prepared for this, having transitioned from 

operating solely as a fund to an institution that 

accesses resources through a broader range 

of financing  mechanisms. 

Additional financing sources . While the 

replenishment will remain the main source 

of financing, under the Additional Resource

cost -effective delivery of development results 

and responsiveness to partner country needs 

and priorities. Internally, IFAD will provide a 

proactive and responsive service that builds 

on client self-sufficiency through user -friendly 

reports, dashboards and portals so as 

to enhance accountability and corporate 

decision-making processes across the 

organization. As  required, IFAD’s information 

and communications technology architecture 

and systems will be upgraded to support 

these reforms. 

Technology, facilities and resources .

IFAD will ensure that its staff has the tools, 

facilities and resources to best contribute to 

its mandate. From a secure, stable platform, 

technology solutions will aim to facilitate and 

enhance the Fund’s operations, beyond the 

traditional focus of administrative efficiency. 

These will be used to streamline the way 

in which IFAD delivers and assesses its 

programmes, to better harness data coming 

from IFAD operations, and to foster a culture 

of data sharing, knowledge management 

and data analytics across the organization 

and  beyond. 

Consistent efforts will be made to enhance 

the skill sets and competencies of IFAD’s 

workforce in light of evolving operational 

objectives, and to refine IFAD’s human 

resources management policies and 

practices to promote a high-level of workforce 

engagement and performance. Dynamic 

internal communications will support these 

efforts and further unify IFAD’s global team. 

Internal oversight . High standards of 

internal oversight will be maintained to 

provide independent assurance and advice 

to Management and governing bodies over 

the efficient and effective implementation of 

planned initiatives and the adequacy of the 

Fund’s risk management processes. IFAD 

will strengthen its capacity to prevent and 

fight corruption and misuse in its activities 

and  operations. 

Financial management capacity . IFAD will 

continue to upgrade its financial management 

capacity in terms of skills and tools. This  will 

affect the areas of investment portfolio 

management, in order to protect financial 

resources in the context of extremely volatile 

markets, and risk management, so as to 

enable IFAD to more effectively capitalize on 

new resource mobilization opportunities. To 

this effect, work has already started to better 

manage financial risks and to be more flexible 

in accommodating the currency of choice in 

the provision of loans to borrowers. 

Loans and grants administration .

In anticipation of changes in the financing 

mix and programme delivery model, IFAD 

will enhance the efficiency of existing 

disbursement arrangements while seeking 

assurance that funds are used for the intended 

purpose. Risk-based assurance mechanisms 

will be further refined to enable use of country 

systems and development of differentiated 

regional or country strategies for financial 

management and procurement. This will 

be supported by client capacity-building 

as a key driver of strengthened fiduciary 

accountability. Automation of loan and grant 

administration will be continued based on a 

new borrower portal and improved electronic 

disbursement  processes. 

Institutional functions, services 

and  systems 

In delivering its development results, IFAD 

will seek to strengthen the effectiveness 

and efficiency of its institutional platform for 

support to Members’ governance activities, 

partnerships, human resource management, 

information and communication technology, 

oversight, internal advisory services, and 

facilities and administrative support. 

Institutional efficiency . IFAD’s key business 

processes will be further rationalized and 

streamlined, building on gains from the 

implementation of the recommendations 

of the IOE corporate-level evaluation of 

IFAD’s institutional efficiency and efficiency 

of IFAD -funded operations, to ensure more 34

The achievement of IFAD’s development 

results faces risks depending on the local, 

country, regional or global context, and these 

risks may be of a policy, political, institutional, 

technical, environmental, security, financial 

or economic nature. Risk management and 

mitigation play a crucial role for IFAD. They will 

continue to be implemented as part of each 

country programme and project development 

process, and at the corporate level through a 

formal enterprise risk management system that 

supports management of key organizational 

risks, and strengthens IFAD’s ability to achieve 

its overall objectives. 

IFAD’s progress in realizing this Strategic 

Framework will be measured through the 

results measurement frameworks (RMFs) 

agreed with Member States in the context of 

the Consultation on the Tenth Replenishment 

of IFAD’s Resources (IFAD10) and future 

replenishment consultations. Performance 

assessments will draw on a range of 

third -party mechanisms in complementarity 

with IFAD’s own self-evaluation system, 

including arm’s length reviews of project 

quality-at -entry and annual in-country 

client -partner surveys. Moreover, in line with 

the IFAD Evaluation Policy, IOE evaluations will 

continue to be used as critical instruments to 

promote accountability for results and learning 

for improved effectiveness. Results  relative to 

targets in the RMF and other commitments 

agreed with Member States will be reported 

annually to the Executive Board and its 

Evaluation Committee in the Report on 

IFAD’s Development Effectiveness (RIDE) and 

the Annual Report on Results and Impact 

of IFAD Operations (ARRI) produced by 

IOE, as well as at the midterm reviews of 

IFAD’s  replenishments. 

The Strategic Framework, along with the RMF 

and commitments agreed with governing 

bodies will be key elements of IFAD’s 

performance planning and management 

system, consisting of: three-year medium-term 

plans to ensure that operations, workforce 

and finances are focused on fulfilling agreed 

commitments and targets; a results-based 

budgeting system to promote optimal and 

economical use of internal resources; and a 

proactive internal results monitoring system 

to facilitate prompt remedial action by 

Management as performance issues arise.
