# FOREWORD 

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development demands a UN development system that is agile, 

cohesive and responsive to a country’s priorities and people’s needs. It requires rights -based 

programming for the Agenda 2030 that is underpinned by robust national analysis, a renewed push for 

collective action and partnerships, and a laser -like focus on helping countries achieve the Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs), leaving no one behind. 

That is the spirit embedded in the new Internal Guidance for the UN Sus tainable Development 

Cooperation Framework, a centerpiece of our reform process. 

Our new Cooperation Frameworks are rooted in four key objectives. 

First, they must clearly articulate the United Nation’s collective response to help countries address 

national priorities and gaps in their pathway towards meeting the SDGs. The Cooperation Framework is 

a vehicle for supporting economic transformation, offering options to reframe economic policies and 

practices around sustainability for inclusive, diversifi ed and job -intensive economic transformation that 

advances the rights and well -being of all citizens, strengthen economies and protects the planet. 

Second, the Cooperation Framework must embody the spirit of partnerships that are at the core of the 

2030 A genda. That means partnerships with host governments -- but also partnerships with all 

stakeholders – civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, bilateral partners - to leverage 

strengths and drive transformative change. Page 6 of 58 

Third, the Cooperat ion Frameworks must help turn our collective promise to leave no one behind into 

tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. UN country teams will need, 

more than ever, to move beyond national averages to look at more specif ic data, with a strengthened 

focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities. 

Finally, the Cooperation Framework must provide UN country teams with the tools to tailor responses to 

a Member State’s specific needs and realities, ensuring that all entities, w hether present on the ground 

or not, can effectively support national implementation of the 2030 Agenda. 

I am grateful to colleagues from across the UN development system for helping to shape this Guidance. 

We know that achieving the 2030 Agenda for eve ryone, everywhere is humanity’s best chance of 

ensuring the progressive realization of human rights and a future of peace and prosperity for all. The 

new UN Cooperation Frameworks offer a tremendous opportunity to scale up implementation of the 

2030 Agend a and demonstrate concrete results on the ground. 

Together, as a UN family, let us harness the full capabilities and assets of the UN development system to 

make it happen.

What’s new? 

1. The United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) has been renamed the United Nations 

Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework ( “Cooperation Framework ”) to more accurately reflect 

the co ntemporary relationship between Governments and the UN development system in collaborating to 

achieve the SDGs. 

2. The new guidelines emphasize the primacy of the Cooperation Framewor k in articulating government 

expectations of the UN development system and in driving major UN development system contributions at 

the country level. U nited Nations entity -specific country programmes are derived from the Cooperation 

Framework , not vice versa. 

3. The Cooperation Framework represents the UN development sy stem’s collective offer to support countr ies 

in addressing key Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) priorities and gaps. It begins and ends with an 

analysis of the national development landscape and SDG priorities, including through the lens of the 

imperativ e to leave no one behind. 

4. The Cooperation Framework serves as a core accountability tool between the UN Country Team (UNCT) and 

the host Government , as well as between and among UNCT members for collectively -owned development 

results . It is supported by mandatory independent , high -quality evaluation and management response s.

5. The UN Common Country Analysis (UN CCA) , which underpins the Cooperation Framework , shifts from a 

one -off event to a “real -time” core analytical function . It is intended to be more agile and reflective of 

evolving country context s. Periodic updating of the UN CCA will reduce the period for form ulating a new 

Cooperation Framework. 

6. SDG targets and indicators become the default monitoring framework, informed by country -defined and 

disaggregated baselines. These indicators will be tracked online through UN INFO at country, regional and 

global level s. 

7. There is explicit recognition of regional and cross -border elements within the UN CCA and the Cooperation 

Framework .

8. The Cooperation Framework triggers a review of the UNCT configuration to ensure it has the capacities to 

deliver on stipulated commitm ents. The Cooperation Framework is signed after this step is completed. 

9. Budgeting follows the signature of the Cooperation Framework . The budget is p ositioned in the larger 

context of SDG financing. 

10. The timeline for preparing the Cooperation Framework decreases from 14.5 months , on average globally, 

to 6 to 9 months . This should reduce transaction s costs for Government s and other stakeholders. 

Maintaining a reasonably updated UN CCA will significantly reduce the period for formulating the 

Coop eration Framework. 

11. The UN Resident Coordinator (RC) plays an enhanced leadership role throughout the Cooperation 

Framework process , in line with General Assembly resolution 72/279 and the new Management and 

Accountability Framework (MAF). 

12. The Cooperation Framework contains a clear statement of the United Nations’ commitment to its normative 

role and to leaving no one behind in implementing the 2030 Agenda. 

13. The Cooperation Framework is linked to new tools for coordination and accountability established as part 

of the repositioning of the UN development system, in line with General Assembly resolution 72/279. Page 8 of 58 

# CHAPTER 1: A PARTNERSHIP FOR ACHIEVING THE 2030 AGENDA 

1. This document provides guidance to UN Country Teams ( UNCTs ) as they plan, finance, deliver and 

evaluate their support to countries in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ), typically 

over a five -year cycle. The U nited Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 

(“Cooperation Framework ”) is at the core of the cycle, co -designed and co -signed by the UN 

development system and the Government. In these guidelines, Cooperation Framework refers both 

to th e document itself and more generally to the key steps and instruments that precede and follow 

its signature. The guidelines are sequenced to follow the normal steps in formulating a new 

Cooperation Framework .

Figure 1: The Cooperation Framework cycle 

1.1. What is the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework? 

2. General Assembly resolution  72/279  elevates the United Nations Development Assistance Framework 

(now renamed 1 the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework) as “the most 

important instrument for p lanning and implementation of the UN development activities at country 

level in support of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 

Agenda) ”. Given the ambition of the 2030 Agenda and the urgency of its timeline, the resoluti on 

represents a significant shift. The Cooperation Framework now guides the entire programme cycle, 

driving planning, implementation, monitoring, reporting and evaluation of collective UN support for 

achieving the 2030 Agenda. The Cooperation Framework det ermines and reflects the UN

development system’s contribution s in the country and shapes the configuration of UN assets 

required inside and outside the country. 

3. The Cooperation Framework is nationally owned, and anchored in national development prioritie s, 

the 2030 Agenda and the principles of the UN Charter. It outlines the UN development system ’s 

contributions sought by national stakeholders to reach the SDGs in an integrated manner, with a 

commitment to leave no one behind, human rights and other inter national standards and obligations. 

Through the Cooperation Framework, the UN development system articulates the highest priority and 

most sustainable development choices for a country. It advises on pathways to maximize synergies 

across the goals and mini mize the opportunity costs of leaving people behind. It shifts from the siloed 

approach of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to a more integrated approach under the 

2030 Agenda and the SDGs. 

4. Since achieving the 2030 Agenda and national development goals requires a broad range of 

stakeholders, the Cooperation Framework significantly broadens the concept of partnerships. It goes 

beyond the previous notion of “implementing partners” to embrace all entities and individuals 

identified as crit ical to forging sustainable development solutions in line with UN values. Based on the 

UN development system’s policy expertise and its comparative advantages, its normative agenda, and 

its ability to leverage, influence and unlock a broad range of resourc es for development, the 

Cooperation Framework reflects: (a) the expectations national stakeholders have of the UN 

development system’s contribution to national development; (b) a shared vision and strategic 

priorities of the United Nations, framed within t he broader landscape of partners; (c) the strategic 

partners with whom the UN system will work in pursuit of development solutions; (d) how the UN 

system and its partners will contribute to accelerating progress towards the 2030 Agenda; and (e) the 

financi al and non -financial commitments of the UN system and partners in the wider context of the 

financing required to reach the SDGs in the country. 

5. The Cooperation Framework is first and foremost a partnership with the Government. 

Development, implementation, monitoring and reporting are co -led by the Government and 

anchored in national development priorities and cycles. The Cooperation Framework is informed by 

Government prioritization, planning, implementation and reporting vis -à-vis the 2030 Agenda, 

including the preparation of evidence -based Voluntary National Reviews 2 based on SDG indicators. 

6. The Cooperation Framework represents a commitment to the people in a country, particularly the 

most marginalized and vulnerable . It calls on the UN development system to: (a) support achieving 

national development goals and targets with a focus on leaving no one behind; (b) help develop 

national development indicator frameworks in line with the 2030 Agenda and the Global SDG 

Indic ator Framework ; (c) address national development needs by including those left behind 

throughout the Cooperation Framework cycle, across all processes and programmes; (d) address 

accountability mechanisms as appropriate for different contexts; 3 (e) make u p-to -date information on 

the Cooperation Framework and expected results and progress publicly available; and (f) ensure 

people’s meaningful participation in development, particularly those left behind.          

> 2This Government -led process articulates a country’s progress and performance against the 2030 Agenda. It can thus be a primary source of
> information about national strategies and partnerships in place to address the cross -cutting challenges and potential trade -offs in attain ing the
> 2030 Agenda and leaving no one behind.
> 3This can include support for strengthening national evaluation policies and systems .

Page 10 of 58 

7. The Cooperation Framework is a com mitment 4 to a broa d range of stakeholders .5 Under national 

leadership and throughout its entire cycle, the Cooperation Framework is a vehicle for identifying 

development solutions through inclusive dialogue. In looking at development trends beyond national 

boundaries, it includes and contributes to regional, subregional and cross -border strategies and 

partnerships, both external and internal to the UN development system. It actively facilitates South -

South cooperation 6and triangular cooperation 7, in complement of official development assistance .

Under the Cooperation Framework, the UN development system pursues all partnerships in line with 

the Common Minimum Standards for Multi -Stakeholder Partnerships developed by the UN 

Sustainable Development Group. Selected with due diligence, UN development s ystem partners 

uphold inclusivity, diversity and representation; transparency and accountability; accessibility and 

safety; and respect for the UN Charter and UN norms and values. 

8. The Cooperation Framework is also a compact among UN development entities, including the UN 

Resident Coordinator (RC). It provides the overarching framework for development results delivered 

collectively and by individual entities. Entities derive country programme outcomes from the 

Cooperation Framework , not vice -versa. Outcomes are hence developed in parallel to, not ahead of, 

the Cooperation Framework. The relation between the RC and the UNCT is managed through the 

Management and Accountability Framework (MAF). 

9. The Cooperation Framework is the centra l framework for joint monitoring, review, reporting and 

evaluation of the UN development system’s impact in a country in achieving the 2030 Agenda .

Under the leadership of the RC, UN development entities are expected to contribute their expertise, 

tools an d platforms in a coherent, integrated and synergistic manner, in line with their respective 

mandates and as agreed in the Cooperation Framework. The United Nations Development 

Programme ( UNDP ) has a specific role in assisting the RC and UNCT to deliver an integrated and 

multidimensional approach to the SDGs, using country platforms as well as other tools, in line with 

General Assembly resolution 72/279 (paragraph 32). The resolution calls on UNDP to be “...the 

support platform of the UN development system , providing an integrator function in support of 

countries in their efforts to realize the 2030 Agenda”. 8

10. The Cooperation Framework leverages all sources of sustainable financing and investments towards 

attaining the 2030 Agenda . Since the UN development system’s financial contribution to national 

development is often relatively small, the UNDAF’s traditional focus on channelling donor support to 

collective UN results has shifted to using the UN development system’s convening power to support

Governments in developing and implementing sustainable financing strategies. The Cooperation 

Framework hence expands fro m “funding ” ( i.e., resource mobilization for UN programmes ) to “SDG 

financing ”, (i.e . leveraging and influencing all available financial flows and instruments in support of 

national priorities for achieving the 2030 Agenda ).

11. The Cooperation Framework is a vehicle for supporting economic transformation. With countries 

emphasizing economic growth as especially important to their development, the Cooperation 

Framework provides specific guidance on reframing economic policies and practices around 

sustainability for inclusive, diversified and job -

intensive economic transformation that leaves no 

one behind , protects the planet and strengthens 

the ecological foundations of economies. 

Economic performance, especially in developing 

countries, is subject to global sho cks and 

fluctuations that often slow, and sometimes derail, 

the achievement of key development priorities. 

The Cooperation Framework therefore supports 

the country in strengthening the resilience of the 

economy through appropriate macroeconomic 

policies, a nd individual resilience through social 

protection and redistributive policies that reduce 

vulnerability and preserve gains against poverty 

and inequality. The UN development system’s 

support focuses on fostering patterns of growth 

that improve the distrib ution of incomes, increase 

economic diversification , and take full advantage 

of appropriate technologies and innovations. This 

includes valuing properly and fully the many non -monetized activities in the modern economy, such 

as unpaid care work, informal l abour and the provision of essential services. It requires a departure 

from past practices in production and consumption , and the embrace of new technologies and 

patterns of behaviour that sustain low -carbon and resource - and energy -efficient growth .

12. The Cooperation Framework is a vehicle for supporting peaceful societies through sustainable 

development strategies specific to diverse country contexts . Putting the SDGs at the heart of the 

Cooperation Framework should enable the UN development system and its partners to contribute to 

ending and preventing conflict and disaster, addressing the impact of climate change, and promoting 

the cohesion and well -being of societies. An enhanced focus on the prevention of vulnerabilities and 

crises protects developm ent gains and provides a conducive environment for the achievement of the 

2030 Agenda. 

13. The Cooperation Framework thus complements - and is informed by - other key policy, programmatic 

and legal frameworks, such as the country reviews undertaken by the different UN human rights 

mechanisms, 9 the Humanitarian Response Plan 10 /Refugee Response Plan 11 and the Integrated      

> 9This includes the Universal Periodic Review, treaty bodies and special procedures of the Human Rights Council.

Contextualizing the Cooperation Framework in 

different count rie s

To make the most meaningful contribution to 

achieving the 2030 Agenda, the Cooperation 

Framework must be based on a strong UN common 

country analysis. It should be flexibly tailored to the 

UN system’s role in a specific country – in particular 

in countries facing situations of conflict, post -

conflict or humanitarian emergency . While the 

Cooperation Framework and subsequent UN 

development activities will differ from country to 

country , a cycle of common elements includes: 

conception and initiation, definition and planning, 

implementation, performance monitoring and 

reporting, and evaluation and closure. Th e

Cooperation Framework guidance and its 

companion pieces refer to the necessary tools to 

carry out these elements. Page 12 of 58 

Strategic Framework in UN mission settings. In protracted crises, the Cooperation Framework reflects 

the “collective outcomes 12 ” that addres s risk and vulnerability. 

14. Finally, the Cooperation Framework must remain responsive to emerging and unforeseen needs .

Annual reviews of progress towards strategic priorities, outcomes and outputs, and assessment of 

significant changes in the country context inform agreement with the Government and relevant 

development partners on UN planned contributions. This is reflected in the signed Cooperation 

Framework document and/or periodically updated UN joint workplans. 

1.2. Cooperation Framework d uration 

15. The Cooperation Framework period is flexible to allow for alignment to national cycles and ensure 

a responsive framework in changing country contexts. The recommended time frame is three to five 

years. Due consideration should be given to the complexity of the country context and the imperative 

to keep the UN response relevant to evolving development priorities within the national development 

plan period. Acceptable transaction costs for UN development entities and partners in the 

Cooperation Framework formulat ion process are another factor. 

1.3. Guiding Principles for the Cooperation Framework 

16. The Cooperation Framework adopts an integrated programming approach. It addresses core 

programming principles in a holistic manner , not as add -on modules. These principles are integrated 

throughout all stages. They guide process as well as content. 

17. By adopting an integrated and multidimensional programming approach —in line with the “five P’s” 

of the 2030 Agenda ( people, prosperity, planet, peace and partnerships ) —the Cooperation 

Framework identifies how working on and advancing one SDG can maximize synergies and positive 

impacts, and manages potential trade -offs. 

18. Leaving no one behind is the central transformative promise of the 2030 Agenda, a rights -based 

framework that represents the unequivocal commitment of all U nited Nations Member States to 

eradicate poverty in all its forms, end discrimination and exclusion, and reduce inequalit ies and 

vulnerabilities including to the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation. 13 This 

means , inter alia, moving beyond assessing overall average and aggregate progress for the general 

population towards ensuring progress for all populati on subgroups 14 . It requires disaggregated data 

and qualitative analysis to identify who is being excluded or discriminated against, how and why, as 

well as who is experiencing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and inequalities. It 

entails i dentifying unjust, avoidable or extreme inequalities in outcomes and opportunities, and 

patterns of discrimination in law, policies and practices. To address patterns of exclusion, structural 

constraints and inequality in all dimensions, the Cooperation Fr amework calls for supporting legal,

policy, institutional and other measures, 15 and for ensuring the free, active and meaningful 

participation of all stakeholders, particularly the most marginalized. 

19. The Human Rights -Based Approach to Development is a conceptual framework for the process of 

sustainable development that is normatively based on international human rights standards and 

principles and operationally directed to promoting and protecting human ri ghts. Under the HRBA, the 

plans, policies and processes of development are anchored in a system of rights and corresponding 

obligations established by international law, including all civil, cultural, economic, political and social 

rights, and the right to development. HRBA requires human rights principles (equality and non -

discrimination, participation, accountability) to guide UN development cooperation, and focus on 

capacity development of both ‘duty -bearers’ to meet their obligations and ‘rights -holders ’ to claim 

their rights. 

20. Gender equality and women’s empowerment are integral to realizing the 2030 Agenda and all of the 

SDGs. To integrate a focus on these issues throughout the Cooperation Framework, UN development 

entities should put gender equality at the heart of programming, driving the active and meaningful 

participation of both women and men, and consistently empowering women and girls, in line with the 

minimum requirements agreed upon by the U nited Nations Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG) 

in the UNCT System -wide Action Plan (SWAP) Gender Equality Scorecard. 16 

21. In an increasingly uncertain and volatile environment, resilience is a key principle to guide the design 

of integrated and cost -effective approaches that reduce risks and help prevent disasters and crises. 

Approaches should be informed by the UN Resilience Framework. 17 Risks comprise those associated 

with natural and hu man -induced hazards, 18 violent conflict, epidemics and pandemics, financial 

systems and food price fluctuations. Drivers of risk stem from poverty, climate change, inequality, 

discrimination and exclusion, extremism, demographic pressures, unplanned urbani zation, ecosystem 

degradation, weak institutions and declining respect for human rights. These negative factors acting 

together can unleash cascading impacts across many dimensions, causing loss of life and livelihoods, 

and setting back progress towards productive, sustainable and peaceful societies .

22. Sustainability guides the focus on maintaining and building on development results. The 2030 Agenda 

calls for ensuring the lasting protection of the planet and its natural and cultural resources, su pporting 

inclusive and sustained economic growth, ending poverty in all its dimensions and enhancing human 

well -being. Strengthening the capacities of national and subnational institutions and communities is 

essential. The Cooperation Framework will, as ap propriate, help to strengthen these institutions so 

that they are appropriately configured, capacitated and resourced to advance the achievement of the 

2030 Agenda. 

23. Accountability : the Cooperation Framework strengthens the UN development system’s 

accounta bility for the collective support it provides to countries in achieving the 2030 Agenda. This 

necessitates: (a) alignment with national priorities and national accountability mechanisms, and

support to their further development where warranted; (b) strengt hening national and local 

mechanisms, institutions and processes to monitor and report on SDG implementation, including 

through the High -level Political Forum and Voluntary National Reviews; (c) measures to build upon 

and extend greater transparency, and i mproved measurement and reporting on results, including 

through joint assessments with target populations; (d) enabling active and inclusive local community 

engagement and participation in decision -making throughout the Cooperation Framework cycle; and 

(e) supporting the development and use of quality, accessible , timely and reliable disaggregated data 

to inform national and UN policy formulation, and programme design, implementation, monitoring 

and evaluation, as well as risk management for development res ults. 

1.4 . Implementing the Cooperation Framework Guiding Principles 

24. The Cooperation Framework employs three mutually reinforcing modes of implementation 19 .

25. Results -focused programming: The SDGs constitute the frame of reference for formulating and 

implementing the Cooperation Framework. Therefore, SDG targets should be reflected in priority 

outcomes that represent changes in institutional and behavioural capacities for development. Usin g

results -based management, the UN development system ensures that resources are directed towards 

improving development conditions for target populations. This requires the identification of critical 

assumptions about the programming environment, and a con sideration of relevant risks and 

management measures. Indicators to monitor progress and measure the achievement of outcomes 

are defined, with attention given to data, evidence generation, and support for national statistical and 

information systems. Accou ntabilities are clearly stipulated and backed by strong reporting 

mechanisms. The focus on results should be maintained throughout the entire Cooperation 

Framework cycle, including during monitoring and evaluation. 

26. Capacity development: Development result s need to be sustained and built upon. Capacity 

development —the process whereby people, organizations and society as a whole unleash, 

strengthen, create, adapt and maintain capacity over time —is critical to sustaining social, economic 

and environmental dev elopment results. It also maximizes effectiveness, efficiency and country 

ownership of development by ensuring that national stakeholders can effectively, efficiently and self -

sufficiently manage and deliver services to target groups. 

27. Coherent policy su pport: The interlinked nature of the SDGs demands policy coherence and more 

integrated, cross -sectoral approaches. The UN development system must combine its diverse and 

complementary mandates, expertise and technical contributions so that it provides effe ctive, 

comprehensive and coherent policy support to national partners. Policy coherence ensures 

consistency across national policy and programmatic frameworks, their alignment with development 

commitment and adherence to international law. Accordingly, Coo peration Frameworks (a) align to 

national priorities and plans, national SDG strategies and targets, and internationally and regionally 

agreed policy frameworks defining integrated approaches to sustainable development; (b) enhance 

synergies between interv ention areas (horizontal coherence) and their alignment with national 

development goals; and (c) strengthen coherence among development, humanitarian and

peacebuilding efforts and human rights mechanisms in relevant contexts for the realization and 

sustainability of peace and development gains. 

1.5. Communications strategy for the revitalized Cooperation Framework 

28. A communications strategy prepared for the Cooperation Framework should help the UN 

development system convey very simply and concretely what the UN development system is doing to 

help a country achieve the SDGs. It should reflect: (a) the vision for the country in 2030; (b) how the 

Cooperation Framework expects to contribute to the “five P’s” and priority pathways to achieve the 

SDGs; (c) the UN development system’s focus, contributions and measurement of results in line with 

the Cooperation Framework Guiding Principles; (d) who is responsible for delivering on what, by when 

and by what means; and (e) how t hese activities are linked to national development, human rights, 

humanitarian and peace frameworks. Dissemination of this information should be in an accessible 

language and format, and consider issues such as disability, language, literacy levels and cul tural 

background. 

29. In line with the commitments in the UN Funding Compact, 20 the UN development system will give 

visibility to core and pooled fund contributions in communicating about the Cooperation Framework. 

# CHAPTER 2: COOPERATION FRAMEWORK DESIGN AND PREPARATION 

## 2.1. Understanding the country’s development landscape 

2.1.1. Alignment to the national development strategy 

30. The priorities of the Cooperation Framework are directly derived from the UN development system’s 

analysis of country priorities and needs, as expressed, for example, in national planning and budgetary 

frameworks, and from other analytical inputs. 

31. Preparing n ational development plans and frameworks 21 are typically participatory processes that 

evolve from extensive multistakeholder consultations and situational analyses. They identify national 

medium -term strategic priorities that are often situated within a long -term vision document, and 

increasingly are aligned with the SDGs as well as regional and subregional development commitments. 

In this context, the Cooperation Framework should align its targets and indicators to the extent 

possible to relevan t targets and indicators in national development plans, which should in turn be 

informed by the SDGs. The UN development system has a role in support ing the Government to 

prepare a national SDG indicator framework .

32. While national development plans signal the priorities of a country, the annual budget and related 

expenditure frameworks demonstrate financial commitments to achieving such priorities. The      

> 20 The Funding Compact is a n agreement by Member States and the United Nations development system to match the boldness of the 2030

Page 16 of 58 

Cooperation Framework prioritization process should be informed by annual budgets and expenditure 

framewor ks to identify unfunded or underfunded national development priorities. Furthermore, 

subnational development plans provide a geographic or spatial dimension to national development 

priorities and needs. Such information, triangulated with data from the UN common country analysis 

(UN CCA ), will be critical in designing targeted interventions to reach groups left behind and tackle 

the root causes of exclusion. 

2.1.2 UN common country analysis 

33. The UN CCA is the UN system’s independent, impartial and collective assessment (i.e., a description 

of a country situation) and analysis (i.e., a description of causes and their implications) of a cou ntry 

situation for its internal use in developing the Cooperation Framework . It examines progress, gaps, 

opportunities and bottlenecks vis -à-vis a country’s commitment to achieving the 2030 Agenda, UN 

norms and standards, and the principles of the UN Charter, including as reflected in the Cooperation 

Framework Guiding Principles. 

34. The Cooperation Framework’s expanded notion of partnerships offers a powerful opportunity to 

engage with relevant stakeholders in the UN CCA process through continuous and inclusive dialogue 

to address complex issues, such as inequality and exclusion, among o thers .

35. The UN CCA will draw from and add to existing data, statistics, analyses, reviews, research, 

capacities and resources from within and outside the UN system. These include national and sector -

specific development visions and strategies, national bud get allocations, and development financing 

from domestic and international, private and public sources. To leave no one behind, it is important 

to generate evidence and data disaggregated not only by income, gender, geography and age , but 

also other ground s of discrimination prohibited under international law. Social, cultural, economic, 

political, legislative and other systemic drivers of exclusion should be examined and described. 

36. The UN CCA will analyse existing data and data gaps for national SDG indicators. It should go beyond 

official national statistics to use new sources of data and diagnostic tools , including but not limited 

to big data, national surveys and assessments, targeted surveys us ing mobile technology and others .

This should be done in accordance with the human rights -based approach to data, international data 

protection standards and the UN Principles on Personal Data Protection and Privacy. 22 Country -

specific findings and recommendations of the Universal Periodic Review and other human rights 

mechanisms will provide an important basis for highlighting gaps and corresponding obligations. 23 The 

UN CCA can build on processes such as the Voluntary National Reviews, the country -specific findings 

and recommendations of UN principal organs, and/or the UNSDG -endorsed Mainstreaming, 

Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS) approach supporting SDG implementation at the country 

level. 24 

37. The UN CCA will identify multidimensional risks t hat could impact the development trajectory of 

the country, covering a full spectrum of development, humanitarian, peacebuilding and human 

rights issues . It should foster common UN system understanding of groups left behind, and underlying 

drivers of risks , vulnerabilities and needs, including those that are social or related to conflict,

disasters, climate change, the environment or the economy. In -depth analysis on these issues 

establishes an understanding of root and proximate causes, stakeholders, dynam ics and triggers, as 

well as the impacts on people, the operational environment and the UN system’s work and presence. 

This analysis should also clarify how UN engagement may influence dynamics, positively and/or 

negatively, and how to manage negative effe cts and maximize positive ones. Involving all relevant UN 

entities, including UN special political missions, peacekeeping operations, humanitarian and human 

rights entities, where relevant, is essential. Where possible, the UN CCA informs the UN Policy on 

Integrated Assessment and Planning. 

38. The UN CCA will integrate analysis of relevant regional, subregional and cross -bo rder dynamics, and 

their impact on achieving the 2030 Agenda in the country. This may include trends and risks related 

to economics and trade, climate change and natural disasters, environmental degradation and 

ecosystem services, conflict and security, migrat ion patterns, health emergencies, and animal, food 

or sanitary emergencies. Such analysis also helps identify opportunities for cross -border dialogue and 

collaboration between countries, including through South -South and triangular cooperation, and UN 

syst em -wide regional strategies. 25 The UN C CA should tap perspectives and expertise from all levels 

of the UN system , including non -resident agencies, Secretariat departments, regional offices of UN 

entities and the UN regional commissions. 

39. To meet the ambi tion of the SDGs, the UN CCA should examine the country’s financial landscape for 

sustainable development, analyse financial flows, and identify the greatest opportunities to re -

orient all sources of financing . It can draw on data from the World Bank, Inte rnational Monetary 

Fund, and other regional and/or international financial institutions. 

40. In order for the UN CCA to adequately serve as the analytical foundation of the Cooperation 

Framework, it should: (a) demonstrate a broad, holistic and integrated ap proach that takes into 

consideration the interlinkages and integrated nature of the SDGs; (b) reflect the interlinkages among 

the three dimensions of sustainable development and all spheres of the UN system’s work; (c) reflect 

the interlinkages between the SDGs and the human rights framework, including treaties and human 

rights monitoring mechanisms; (d) build on all sources of data and analysis from a broad range of 

partners; and (e) focus on prevention and the interlinkages between sustainable developmen t, human 

rights, sustaining peace, and the shift from response to preparedness to meet the challenges of the 

future. 

41. For more specific details, refer to the updated companion guidance on the UN CCA. It provides 

analytical tools and practical tips, includi ng a UN CCA outline. 26 

42. The UN CCA is not a one -off event. It should track situational developments and inform the UN 

system’s work on a continuous basis. It is now a core analytical function carried out by the UN 

development system at country, regional and global level . A repository for data and analysis should 

be established at the country level. It should include SDG data, and combine various analytical 

resources held, updated and made available by UN entities across the UN system.            

> 25 For the case of Africa, the Middle -Income Countries (MIC) Strategy, the Regional Strategy for Resilience ,and the Great Lakes Peace and Security
> Cooperation Framework can be mentioned ,among others.
> 26 The companion guidance on UN CCA is under development.

Page 18 of 58 

43. The UN CCA should be updated periodically to serve as a current analytical resource and to reduce 

the time required for formulating a new Cooperation Framework. The UNCT may organize 

multistakeholder dialogues on evolving country context s.

2.1.3. SDG analytical toolbox 

44. The 2030 Agenda d emands a significant increase in UN development system capacities in terms of 

coordinated analysis, as well as policy and programme design. A focus on integration requires the 

adoption of a systems approach to development. It addresses interlinkages across economic, social 

and environmental dimensions in line with the Cooperation Framework Guiding Principles. Further, 

the SDGs must be owned at all levels —global, regional, national, sub -national, rural and urban .

Progress depends on truly collective action: a “whole -of -government, whole -of -society” approach. 

Cross -border and regional collaboration assume greater importance than ever before. The ability to 

consider longer time horizons is essential in finding solutions for today’s most pressing problem s while 

anticipating risks that may still be emerging. The commitment to leave no one behind calls for greater 

granularity of data , quantitative and qualitative analysis, to design evidence -based interventions that 

identify, empo wer and support the most vu lnerable and address root causes. Similarly, advising 

countries on transformative economic pathways that are environmentally sustainable and socially 

inclusive call for levering all possible SDG financing flows – public and private, domestic and 

internatio nal. 

45.  UNCTs should leverage expertise from across the development system in the Cooperation Framework 

process. In addition to knowledge and technical resources within the UNCT, the UN Sustainable 

Development Group is committed to creating a community of practice to support SDG 

implementation. Initiatives such as a MAPS engagement 27 or regional “cluster” mechanisms can bring 

together a tailored coalition of UN and other experts to help augment UNCT capacity. They can 

provide support and solutions for such issues as enabling multistakeholder engagement; identifying 

policy accelerators; analysing and utilizing all forms of data; analysing SDG financing flows and 

strengthening financing partnerships. This will ensure that UNCTs expand capacities at a critical point 

while better connecting regional -level engagements to the core work of the UNCT. 

46. Countries require new policy tools to meet the ambition of the SDGs, ranging from regulatory policies 

to planning, budgeting and political instruments that last beyond relatively short -term planning cycles 

and can propel deeper transformations for sustainable development. UNCTs will be able to access , in 

a coordinated and coherent way, a number of tools for integrated policy support . These include : the 

SDG Monitoring and Reporting Toolkit for UNCTs; 28 quantitative and qualitative methodologies to 

support the identification of SDG “accelerators”; 29 action at local, national and global levels to advance 

the data revolution for the SDGs 30 ; the use of Development Finance Assessments to link financing with 

sustainable development results 31 ; new platforms and approaches for sustainability and innovation; 32 

and new ways to address risk and resilience, to mention just a few.

## 2.2. Cooperation Framework design process 

2.2.1. Theory of change 

47.  The 2030 Agenda set forth an ambitious and transformational vision to be achieved in a relatively 

short span of time. With the path to 2030 shaped by developments and trends that are inherently 

unpredictable and possibly unprecedented in their impacts, the UN development system and its 

partners need to manage change and uncertainty through longer -term strategic planning. 

48.  A visioning exercise is an integral starting point for formulating the Cooperation Framework. This 

exercise examines: (a) t he Government ’s vision of its long -term development trajectory through 2030, 

where this exists, and current national development plans ; (b) the UN development system‘s internal 

and external working assumptions, considering the country’s possible long -term development 

trajectories to 2030 in line with t he Cooperation Framework Guiding Principles ; (c) the UN 

devel opment system’s comparative advantage, positioning and evolving role in the country through 

2030 ; and ( d) successive Cooperation Framework cycle s along the overall country trajectory towards 

2030. 

49.  This visioning exercise should be consultative, collaborat ive and inclusive so that it is truly shared and 

owned by the UN development system, the Government and all relevant stakeholders, including 

people furthest left behind. This requires measures to ensure stakeholders are informed, empowered 

and can provide inputs, including through geographic outreach if necessary . The UN development 

system can undertake this exercise in a flexible manner, using a range of tools and processes. 

50.  With 2030 in sight, the UN development system must design Cooperation Frameworks that will truly 

make a difference in less than three cycles. Therefore, the vision of its contribution and the design of 

medium -term support must be grounded in a clearly articulated, evidence -based, robust theory of 

change that describes the interdependent changes necessary for the country to achieve the 2030 

Agenda. The theory of change is a comprehensive articulation of different pathways and choices that 

illustrate how and why the desired change is expected to happen , and the risks and bottlenecks to 

be addressed .

51.  The theory of change should be based on the needs of the country (demand ) and examined through 

the lens of the Cooperation Framework Guiding Principles, rather than just the immediately available 

capacities and resources available ( supply ) of the UN development system and other partners. The 

theory of change shows where and how development actors need to come together to contribute to 

the desired change, providing the basis for wider, higher quality and transform ational partnerships. 

Based on a shared understanding of opportunities, risks and bottlenecks, and the inequalities that 

persist, the UN development system agrees on results t hat it can contribute to through the UNCTs 

own resources and through leveraging t hose of other stakeholders . It also identifies areas of 

comparative advantage for the UN development system to make its best collective contribution. To 

leave no one behind, the theory of change must address structural barriers to equality, resources and 

opportunities, and any discriminatory laws, social norms and stereotypes that perpetuate inequalities 

and disparities. 

52.  The UN development system needs to be mindful of the complexity of attaining the 2030 Agenda and 

the SDGs in the local con text, which will evolve over time. Therefore, the theory of change needs to Page 20 of 58 

be adaptable, drawing on the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of findings generated during the 

implementation of the Cooperation Framework as well as the “living” UN CCA. 

2.2.2 Strategic priorities 

53. Underpinned by a robust UN CCA and vision, the UN development system contributions in support of 

national -led efforts to achieve 2030 Agenda should be reflected in the Cooperation Framework. The 

UN development system cannot and should not attempt to address all developm ent issues in a 

country . It must choose , in consultation with national partners, strategic priorities and related 

development results (outcomes and outputs) in which to invest its collect ive eff orts, capacities and 

resources . These choices must be underpi nned by a candid assessment of the comparative advantage 

of the UN system vis -à-vis other development actors. Such a process will ensure that the UN 

development system is positioned to respond effectively to national priorities and provide added 

value from joint UN action while leveraging the contributions of others. In essence, UN support must 

be catalytic and transformational. 

54. The following filters are applied to define strategic priorities: (a) determine the most pressing and 

critical national develop ment priorities and gaps, and related bottlenecks and entry points; (b) 

determine strategic catalytic solutions and strategies to address these; (c) match these solutions and 

strategies with the UN development system’s mandates, and global, regional and se ctoral priorities 

in line with international and regional norms and standards, and the priorities of the System -Wide 

Strategic Document, 33 (d) test prioritized solutions and strategies with regard to advancing and 

aligning with the Cooperation Framework Gu iding Principles; ( e) consider UN complementarity with 

other stakeholders through mapping, and an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and 

threats; (f) assess the UN development system’s human and financial resources, knowledge, 

technology, networks and efficiencies, both current and potential; and ( g) reflect on lessons learned 

and evidence from research and evaluations. 

55. Typically, a strategic priority comprises a limited number of outcomes and outputs. Overall, the 

numbers must be realistic, together reflecting the strategic focus of the UN development system 

during a Cooperation Framework cycle . The outcomes and outputs must also reflect a shift from the 

MDGs to the SDGs by allowing the Cooperation Framework Guiding Principles to steer their definition. 

Outcomes and outputs are developed concurrently during the Cooperation Framework design stage. 

Outputs help complete the logic for Cooperation Framework results, and ensure the transparency and 

accountability of UN de velopment system contributions. They are central to future steps in the cycle, 

particularly vis -à-vis UNCT configuration and financing requirements. 

2.2.3. Cooperation Framework outcomes 

56. In line with the UNSDG Results -based Management Handbook, 34 “outc omes” represent changes in 

the institutional and behavioural capacities for development. Outcomes should: (a) make a 

substantive and measurable contribution to the achievement of the selected priorities of the national 

development framework and the 2030 Ag enda; (b) directly address key issues/development 

challenges and bottlenecks identified by the UN common country analysis, including the needs of   

> 33 Currently under development.
> 34 https://undg.org/wp -content/uploads/2016/10/UNDG -RBM -Handbook -2012.pdf

Page 21 of 58 

those furthest behind; (c) be specific, realistically achievable within the Cooperation Framework cycle ,

susta inable and measurable, ensuring accountability and monitoring; (d) Include special measures to 

address the Cooperation Framework Guiding Principles as per the findings from the UN CCA; and (e) 

reflect the contributions of one or more organizations as clear ly highlighted in the Cooperation 

Framework results matrix. 

57. The Cooperation Framework should be consistent with international human rights law .35 In settings 

comprising development, humanitarian and peacebuilding efforts, outcomes incorporate or are 

coherent and mutually reinforcing with those of other UN planning frameworks in a given country, 

irrespective of whether they are managed separately or in an integrated manner. 

2.2.4. Cooperation Framework outputs 

58. The UNSDG RBM Handbook describes “outputs” as changes in skills or the abilities and capacities of 

individuals or institutions, or the availability of new products and services that result from the 

completion of a development intervention. Results at outpu t level are directly attributable to the UN 

system and contribute to outcomes. Country development programmes of each UN development 

entity flow from Cooperation Framework outcomes and outputs. 

59. Due to their direct attribution to the UN development system , Cooperation Framework outputs will 

provide the basis for the RC to lead the formal discussion with the Government on the UN expertise, 

capacity and resources required by the Cooperation Framework, in line with General Assembly 

resolution 72/279 and the M AF. The UN development system should develop both outcomes and 

outputs during the Cooperation Framework design stage to ensure a clear logic in the results matrix 

and for transparency and accountability of UN development system contributions . UNCTs may opt to 

place outputs either in both the Cooperation Framework document and joint workplans or only in the 

latter. 

60. The UN development system should analyse to what extent its planned contributions (outputs) are 

part of the Cooperation Framework, and whether they form part of other frameworks, such as a 

Humanitarian Response Plan, 36 Refugee Response Plans 37 /Comprehensive Refugee Response 

Framework, 38 an Integrated Strategic Framework in integrated mission settings or others. The system 

should assess how these may connect to and complement each other. 

2.2.5. Indicators 

61. The Cooperation Framework outcome and output indicators should, by default, be li nked to national 

SDG indicator frameworks, which should ideally be linked to regional 39 and global 40 SDG indicator 

frameworks. This enables standardization and aggregation to better measure and report on 

development results against the 2030 Agenda at the regional and global levels. This commitment is 

part of the 2019 Funding Compact. Other globally accepted indicators can be included to measu re

intermediary results. Disaggregation of indicators makes it possible to see the extent to which the UN 

has contributed to development results that “leave no one behind” and uphold Cooperation 

Framework Guiding Principles. 

2.2.6. Completion, review and validation of the Cooperation Framework 

62. Under the leadership of the RC, the Cooperation Framework will be prepared using the standard 

outline in Annex 3 , with a legal annex ( Annex 4 ) as an integral part . Every effort must be made to 

reduce transactional costs for both the UN development system and its partners. 

63. In countries with UN missions, the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary -General/RC must 

share the draft Cooperation Framework with the Integrated Taskforce. The Task Force is expected to 

provide feedback within seven working days. 

64. Respective regional/global platforms will engage in Cooperation Framework preparation in line with 

the regional/global MAF. Regional/global feedback on the draft Cooperation Framework must be 

provided to the UNCT within seven working days from date of receipt. Thereafter, the UN 

development system should submit a final draft for feedback from the Government, and other key 

stakeholders and development partners. 

# CHA PTER 3: UNCT CONFIGURATION IN SUPPORT OF THE COOPERATION 

# FRAMEWORK 

65. A new Cooperation Framework represents a set of expectations of the Government matched with a 

set of undertakings by the UN development system. Rarely is a Cooperation Framework setting out 

an entirely new agenda. More typically, it contains both familiar results and the unfinished business 

of the previous Cooperation Framework , as well as new support areas. A certain number of 

programmes from the previous Cooperation Framework will inevitably continue until completion. 

Nonetheless, formulating it should in clude reviewing the UNCT’s assets and configuration for the task 

at hand. This should be an iterative process fully involving all concerned entities. 

66. A UNCT consists of UN entities both physically present in the country and contributing remotely. It 

also includes UN entities with mandates beyond the purely developmental. The review of UNCT 

configuration entails a look at capacities needed to deliver on the prioritized outcomes in the 

Cooperation Framework, beyond financial considerations, which are addres sed separately . The 

discussion on UNCT configuration should include both an internal analysis and consultation with the 

Government and donor partners, reviewing inter alia: 

a. What kind of expertise and services will the UNCT need to provide to deliver on the 

Cooperation Framework? From which agencies can these be sourced? 

b. To what extent would these services need to be delivered by an in -country/resident UN 

agency presence? What aspects could be delivered from a regional or global base? 

c. What new implementation modalities could be leveraged? 

d. To what extent can some services be delivered by local service providers? Which activities 

should be delivered directly by UN entities and which ones through working with 

implementing partners? Page 23 of 58 

e. To what extent does the new Co operation Framework imply a major increase in delivery 

capacity by one or more members of the UNCT, and what would that scaling up require? 

67. A review of UNCT configuration responds to U nited Nations Member States’ call for a “needs -based 

tailored country -presence” 41 . This call followed the Secretary -General’s recommendation that the 

“United Nations development system move away from a somewhat standardized model of physical 

presence, which largely ref lects the historical evolution of each individual entity” 42 to one that ensures 

“the right system -wide capacities and encourage(s) more integrative, effective and agile ways of 

working” 43 . This process is much larger than the question of which agency needs to be resident or not. 

Coupled with the re -organization and redeployment of regional assets, the reconfiguration of 

business models in connection with multicountry offices, and the ambitious changes planned for 

common services, implicit in a configuration review is the ability to draw on a much wider palate of 

options in accessing the full UN development system’s capacities. Preparation of a new Cooperation 

Framework should trigger a discussion on these issues and related actions to deliver on commitments. 

68. After determining the UNCT configuration, the final Cooperation Framework document plus its legal 

annex are signed by the Government and UN development entities. At this point, the Cooperation 

Framework is not formally required to be accompanied by a budget. 44 

# CHAPTER 4: FINANCING THE SDG S AND FUNDING THE COOPERATION 

# FRAMEWORK 

## 4.1. Financial landscape analysis 

69. An in -depth look at the volume and mix of resources required to deliver Cooperation Framework 

outcomes and the bigger picture of SDG financing requirements is a key step. This analysis is 

undertaken after Cooperation Framework priorities, outcomes, outputs and the UNCT configuration 

have been determined. The assessment of priority development needs drives conversat ion about 

available resources and resource mobilization needs, not the other way around. 

70. The UNCT should address the connected and mutually reinforcing elements of SDG financing and 

Cooperation Framework funding. One set of considerations involves: (a) the financing landscape and 

how the Cooperation Framework is situated within it, (b) identification of financial flows that can be 

influenced a nd leveraged by the Cooperation Framework towards SDG attainment, and (c) potential 

funding sources (traditional and non -traditional) for the Cooperation Framework. Another set of 

factors comprises how available Cooperation Framework funding can (a) cataly se broader financing 

and investment flows towards achieving the SDGs, (b) support the formulation and implementation 

of the financing framework of the Government, and (c) complement and fill strategic gaps in national 

and other budgetary allocations.

## 4.2 . The Cooperation Framework funding framework 

71. In line with the commitments in the global Funding Compact, the UN development system will 

develop a Funding Framework (replacing the previous Common Budgetary Framework) that is based 

on an assessment of the resources required to deliver the Cooperation Framework. It presents overall 

funding needs to achieve prioritized outcomes, identifies available resources and makes visible the 

remaining funding gaps. It outlines the strategy for securing needed resources, including through 

analysis of various types that can be mobilized (e.g. core funding; global/vertical and country -level 

pooled UN development system; agency -specific thematic UN development system; and other non -

core resources). 

72. The Funding Framework is the basis for periodic funding dialogues with the Government and donors 

that recognize the need to better align funding support to the UN development system with the needs 

of the Cooperation Framework. The Funding Framework is translated and operationaliz ed annually as 

part of UN joint workplans. 

73. Funding follows the needs -based logic underpinning the Cooperation Framework. The budgets and 

resource mobilization strategies of UN development entities should be aligned with the Cooperation 

Framework budget, not vice versa. 

4.3. Linking Cooperation Framework funding with SDG financing 

74. The Cooperation Framework must depart from its traditional dominant focus on mobilizing financial 

resources for the UN system’s development work. The UN development system should seek to 

leverage different sources of financing and investment flows outside the UN system that support 

Governments in financing national priorities to achieve the SDGs. Beyond its own funding 

requirements, the UNCT should facilitate a dialogue on the volume and mix of financing required to 

achieve the SDGs. It should explore ways to connect more strongly with domestic financing, such as 

by engaging with and influencing national budget processes, decisions and priorities. 

75. This approach acknowledges that implementing the SDGs requires attracting, leveraging and 

mobilizi ng investments from all possible sources to close the global SDG funding gap, which is 

estimated in the trillions. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda and 

lays the foundations for financing the SDGs. It highlights the need for “cohesive, nationally owned 

development strategies supported by integrated financing frameworks ”45 .

76. The  UN Secretary -General’s SDG Financing Strategy  underscores the UN system’s critical role in 

supporting and accelerating the mobilization of finance for sustainable development from national 

and international, and public and private sources. The system can sup port the development of 

regulatory frameworks, financing mechanisms and related partnerships; advise on how to mobilize 

and leverage necessary financing; and assess possible strengths and disadvantages of financing 

options. This process may include enhanci ng national capacities in areas such as domestic resource 

mobilization, assuring the quality of public spending, fiscal and debt management, de -risking 

investments, developing capital markets or fostering investment -grade business environments. The 

Coopera tion Framework should be the central instrument outlining UN contributions in line with the 

Principles for Engagement in SDG Financing.

> Figure 2: Cooperation Framework financing and funding strategy

77. Beyond the UN’s own Funding Framework, the UNCT should: 

a. Map and analyse the financing landscape for the SDGs and outline how to maximize impact 

through smart investment of existing resources, greater access to additional resources and 

better leveraging of larger financial flows. 

b. Build on existing data o n financial flows as provided by the international financial institutions, 

the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) and others, and the 

Integrated National Financing Framework , to the extent possible. 

c. Articulate necessary partners hips among UN development entities and between them and 

external stakeholders, such as the international financial institutions and the private sector. 

d. Identify (a) priority SDGs within the country; (b) the approximate amount of financing needed 

to achieve (each) SDG; (c) domestic, international, public and private financing flows, and 

relevant stakeholders; and (d) instruments and modalities through which the UN 

development system’s resources can be paired with other financial flows. In line with 

Cooperati on Framework outcomes, the last could include, for example, a national window in 

a UN fund or programme designed and implemented as a first tranche of a larger sectoral 

approach drawing on funding outside the UN system. 

e. Identify specific financing opportun ities that reduce inequalities and exclusion, such as those 

that target finance to the poorest areas of a country. Page 26 of 58

# CHAPTER 5: COOPERATION FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTATION 

78. UN development entity country development programming instruments, Cooperation Framework 

results groups, joint w ork plans and joint workplan annual reviews are key tools for implementing the 

Cooperation Framework. 

5.1. Implementing the Cooperation Framework through UN development system entity 

country development programmes 

79. The Cooperation Framework is implemented th rough UN development system entity instruments for 

country development programming. These entities must derive their development programming 

from the Cooperation Framework based on three options: 

- Option A : UN development system entities adopt the Cooperat ion Framework as their own 

country development programme document; they do not prepare a separate entity 

document. 

- Option B : UN development system entities develop an entity -specific country development 

programme document with Cooperation Framework outcome s copied verbatim. 

- Option C: UN development system e ntities develop an entity -specific country development 

programme document with Cooperation Framework outcomes copied verbatim, plus 

additional outcomes that are not in the Cooperation Framework , included only on an 

exceptional basis to capture normative an d standard -setting activities not prioritized in the 

Cooperation Framework. Page 27 of 58 

80. UN development entities with global or regional programmes or without specific country programme 

documents should pursue any additional activities not directly relating to the Co operation Framework 

in line with the MAF. 

81. UN development entities that submit country development programming instruments to their 

governing mechanisms for approval should do so together with the Cooperation Framework strategic 

priorities, outcomes and outputs. Once a new Cooperation Framework is approved, entities will align 

specific country development programming documents at the earliest opportunity and no later than 

the annual review. 

82. In line with General Assembly resolution 72/279 an d the MAF, t he RC coordinates implementation of 

the Cooperation Framework and works with UNCT members to align UN development system entity 

country development programmes with the Cooperation Framework and the 2030 Agenda. The RC 

will have the opportunity to review and comment on entities’ country development programming 

documents before their submission to governing mechanisms , with a view to confirming alignment 

and coherence with the Cooperation Framework, identifying opportu nities for synergies and 

complementarities, and avoiding duplication and overlap. 

5.2. Coordinating Cooperation Framework implementation through results groups 

83. Each Cooperation Framework strategic priority must have a corresponding results group. A resu lts 

group comprises contributing UN development entities (resident and non -resident) and is chaired or 

co -chaired by UN heads of agencies. Results groups improve internal coordination and ensure a 

coherent UN system -wide approach to a strategic priority. T hey make the UN development system a 

more effective partner and reduce transactions costs for stakeholders. Results groups must meet at 

least once every two months. 

84. Where possible, results groups are aligned with and feed into existing Government -led working 

structures, such as sector working groups, clusters, etc. This enables UN coherence in both 

representation and contributions to external mechanisms. If equivalent Government -led groups do 

not exist, results groups should incorporate relevant national and international partners, and be co -

chaired with relevant Government counterparts. 

85. Under the leadership of the RC, results groups develop UN joint workplans to oper ationalize the 

Cooperation Framework, identify opportunities for closer inter -agency collaboration (e.g., through 

joint programmes), collectively monitor and report on progress towards joint outputs, and provide 

periodic inputs to update the UN CCA. UNCTs are encouraged to establish working mechanisms such 

as them atic groups or advisory capacity to mainstream Cooperation Framework Guiding Principles 

across the work of results groups. 

5.3. Coordinating Cooperation Framework implementation through joint work plans 

86. Joint workplans reflect : Cooperation Framework outputs; all related key UN development 

contributions delivered jointly or by individual entities, with a view to maximizing synergies and 

avoiding duplication; and resources that are required and available as well as funding gaps. Joint 

workplans may be a nnual or multi -year as appropriate to the country context .Page 28 of 58 

5.4. UN development system joint programming and joint programmes 

87. Under joint programming, UN organizations and national partners collectively prepare, implement, 

monitor and evaluate development activities aimed at achieving the 2030 Agenda and other 

international and regional commitments. 

88. In preparing and reviewing joint workplans, Cooperation F ramework results groups may identify the 

need for increased joint delivery through one or more joint programmes. A joint programme is a set 

of activities contained in a joint workplan and related Funding Framework, involving two or more UN 

entities contrib uting to the same Cooperation Framework outputs. Pooled funding or other funding 

mechanisms can fund joint programmes. Other stakeholders can be engaged as implementing 

partners. 

89. UN missions and humanitarian actors also engage in joint programmes, where a ppropriate , for a 

country. Joint programmes can be attractive to funding partners, since the modality provides greater 

assurance of UN coherence in delivering results and reduces transaction costs. 

5.5. UN INFO 

90. UN INFO is an online planning, monitoring and reporting platform that digitizes each Cooperation 

Framework and its corresponding joint workplans. It reflects the UN development system’s effort to 

improve coherence, transparency and accountability, and to better address the needs and pri orities 

of U nited Nations Member States. Initially conceived at the country level, UN INFO provides an 

overview of country level progress as well as regionally and globally aggregated information, both for 

the UN development system under the Cooperation Fr amework and individual entities. This includes 

how the UN development system in each country is channelling resources towards national priorities, 

thematic issues (including based on cross -cutting gender, human rights and humanitarian markers) 

and the SDGs . It encourages more regular monitoring of joint workplans so that all development 

activities are on track to deliver results. This enables senior leadership to make corrections to 

programming or shift resources in real -time. The public can also see a full picture of UN development 

system activities through public dashboards linked to UNCT websites. 

91. UN INFO is being rolled out as a universal tool. As an evidence -based approach to UN development 

system coordination, it will eventually integrate data direct ly from entities’ enterprise resource 

planning systems. UN development system entities, with support from the RC and the monitoring and 

evaluation ( M&E ) group, should regularly update the system with quality assured, entity -specific data 

and analysis. 

# CHAPTER 6: COOPERATION FRAMEWORK MONITORING, REPORTING AND 

# EVALUATIONS 

6.1. Adaptive programming 

92. Development is never linear, as the operational environment and risks at local, national, trans -

boundary, regional and global levels are in constant flux. Cooperation Framework assumptions may 

not hold, and the actions of partners may not happen as anticip ated. This is particularly relevant in Page 29 of 58 

fragile and conflict -affected settings. Programming thus requires an adaptive approach, based on 

learning from new information and evidence. This allows for adjustments to achieve expected results 

in a changing operat ing environment. While the Cooperation Framework outcomes may remain stable 

for the duration of the cycle, outputs and activities may need correction to remain relevant , while 

maintaining accountability to partners. At the e nd of every cycle, a Cooperation Framework 

evaluation must draw lessons to inform the next cycle. 

93. Cooperation Framework results groups and joint workplans are mechanisms for adaptive 

programming and should be supported by the M&E group . Results groups jointly review outputs, 

activities and budgets in response to new information, lessons and risks emerging from continuous 

analysis, monitoring (including real -time) and evaluation. Through adaptive programming, the RC and 

UN development system entities make informed decisions, encourage risk tolerance and 

management, and foster an appetite for experimentation and the reasonable acceptance of failure. 

94. To support adaptive programming, the UN development system should develop a costed multi -year 

joint monitoring and evaluation plan for the full Cooperation Framework period . This plan should 

be formulated at the Cooperation Framework design phase . UN development system entity M&E 

plans should be coordinated with and reflected in the Cooperation Framework M&E plan . They should 

be appropriately timed, sequenced and executed to contribute to Cooperation Framework annual 

reviews, annual UN country results reporting and the final Cooperation Framework evaluation, to the 

extent feasible. 

6.2. Monitoring and learning 

95. Monitoring and learning are preconditions for tracking progress of the Cooperation Framework 

contribution to the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, evolving risks and opportunities, and t he adjustment 

of the programme as part of adaptive management. 

96. As both the endpoint of one Cooperation Framework cycle and the starting point for another, the 

initial UN CCA report 46 constitutes the baseline for monitoring and evaluating the Cooperation 

Framework. 

97. Joint monitoring throughout the Cooperation Framework cycle should ensure that the UN 

development system is (a) delivering on the commitment to leave no one behind, and achieving 

results that uphold the Cooperation Framework Guiding Principles; (b) helping national partners 

develop capacities; (c) mitigating driver s of conflict, disaster risks, humanitarian crises and complex 

emergencies, including through greater cooperation and complementarity among activities related to 

development, disaster risk reduction, humanitarian action and sustaining peace; (d) fostering new 

and effective partnerships between national stakeholders and international actors, including through 

South -South and triangular cooperation; and (e) promoting integrated and coherent policy support. 

98. Frequent high -quality (and where possible real -time) monitoring, review and reporting on the 

Cooperation Framework are necessary to make it responsive to changing contexts. UN development 

entities must increasingly synchronize individual monitoring systems for development results with the 

Cooperation Framew ork M&E system, where possible and relevant.     

> 46 The first CCA report on the basis of which the Coopera tion Framework was initially designed.

Page 30 of 58 

99. More specifically, UN development entities should monitor and report on the quality of 

implementation; results achieved; risks, threats and opportunities emerging in achieving the SDGs; 

resources leveraged for financing the SDGs; resources mobilized and delivered by the UN 

development system, guided by principles of equity and value added for money; the continued validity 

of the theory of change and ; innovations .

100. The UN development system’s joint monitoring sys tems, resources and activities, and collective 

planning and investment in monitoring services and technologies should support the strengthening 

of national data and information systems. 

101. The UN results groups and M&E groups should meet at least twice a year to reflect on and learn 

from implementation monitoring reports, including on SDG indicators, issues and synergies across 

priority areas. 

6.3. Reporting 

102. The UN development system reports periodically to the RC on progress in achieving Cooperation 

Fr amework outcomes and outputs through UN INFO. It should also provide updates on work related 

to outcomes not in the Cooperation Framework, as in Option “C” under paragraph 7 9 above. The RC 

should submit the One UN Country Results Report to the host Government and key partners at least 

once a year. This can feed into Government thematic/sector reports as well as Voluntary National 

Reviews at the High -level Political Forum. 

## 6.4. Evaluating the Cooperation Framework 

103. Evaluation of the Cooperation Framework is an independent system -wide process at the country 

level that contributes to system -wide oversight, transparency, accountability and collective learning. 47 

It is vital for ensuring greater transparency on results achieved, promoting joint work and efficiencies, 

and generating knowledge that informs and improves development programming. 

104. Using the initial UN CCA report as a benchmark, the Cooperation Framework evaluation assesses 

whether expected results were achieved, if other unintended results are observed, and whether the 

Cooperation Framework made a worthwhile, coherent, durable and cost -efficient contribution to 

co llective UN system outcomes and national development processes to achieve the 2030 Agenda. 

Cooperation Framework evaluations should enable UNCTs to assess the extent to which they have 

conformed with Cooperation Framework Guiding Principles in terms of bot h process and results. By 

identifying synergies, gaps, overlaps and missed opportunities, evaluations provide the basis for 

critical inquiry as an integral part of efforts to continuously improve performance and results. They 

also play a role in supporting social and environmental safeguarding efforts. The Cooperation 

Framework evaluation informs the visioning exercise, theories of change and the strategic 

prioritization process of the subsequent Cooperation Framework cycle.    

> 47 Independent system -wide evaluation is a systematic and impartial assessment of the combined contributions of United Nations entities towards
> the achievements of collective development objectives. The Secretary General’s December 2017 report on the repositioning of the UN
> development system ( A/72/684 –E/2018/7) , General Assembly resolution 72/729 and the Funding Compact position independent system -wide
> evaluations as instruments for achie ving system -wide oversight, transparency, accountability and collective learning .

Page 31 of 58 

105. Independent reviews of past and current Cooperation Framework evaluations found that they are 

uneven in adherence to core evaluation norms, standards and principles; lack independence and 

sufficient system buy -in; are not easily accessible by partners; do not sufficiently inform subsequ ent 

planning and programming choices; and are not adequately resourced. Quality and credibility must 

improve for use at higher levels of aggregation and synthesis in regional and global system -wide 

evaluation processes, including, but not limited to meta -analysis. 

106. Given the importance of robust accountability, the Cooperation Framework evaluation must 

adhere to international best practices for evaluation and the U nited Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) 

Norms and Standards. 48 It should also aim to reflect the evaluation indicators in the Funding Compact, 

the UN -SWAP and the United Nation Disability Inclusion Strategy. Evaluation procurement, design and 

all other processes should build on and, wherever feasible, strengthen nati onal and regional 

evaluation capacities in partnership with voluntary organizations for the professionalization of 

evaluation. 

107. Interim guidelines for system -wide evaluation 49 and UNEG guidance will complement 

Cooperation Framework evaluation companion guidance. 50 Guidance will include specific and 

practical steps on design, conduct, content and use. It will outline governance and management 

arrangements, disclosure and communi cation policies, and roles and responsibilities. 

108. An independent Cooperation Framework evaluation should be commissioned in the penultimate 

year of the Cooperation Framework period. Joint Cooperation Framework -country development 

programme document evalua tions are encouraged to reduce transactions costs for the UNCT and 

partners, and to benefit from substantive links. In cases where this is not possible, the UNCT should 

explore opportunities to establish common components between the two kinds of evaluatio ns. To 

that end, the common, costed Cooperation Framework monitoring and evaluation plan will include 

both entity -specific evaluations as well as the Cooperation Framework evaluation. 

109. The RC and UNCT play a pivotal role in the evaluation process. The RC e nsures an independent 

final and useful Cooperation Framework evaluation by facilitating and promoting national ownership ,

through involvement of national partners throughout the process and through the timely 

incorporation of findings, recommendations and lessons into decision -making around subsequent UN 

CCAs and Cooperation Frameworks, as well as within the country development programming of 

respective United Nations development entities. The RC and UNCT should provide an independent 

evaluation team with a ll required information and access to national stakeholders, and coordinate 

entity -specific evaluations so they are relevant and timely in supporting the Cooperation Framework 

evaluation. The RC and UNCT must issue a n evaluation management response and act ion plan as a 

key accountability tool. They are responsible for publicly disclosing the final evaluation at the country 

level as part of an overall communications and dissemination strategy. Specific roles and 

responsibilities of the RC and the UNCT will b e outlined in the forthcoming M&E companion guide and 

will form part of RC/UNCT performance appraisals.

# CHAPTER 7: COOPERATION FRAMEWORK GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN 

# SUPPORT OF NATIONAL OWNERSHIP 

110. Cooperation Framework governance is nationally owned . It could include the following 

mechanisms. 

111. National/UN Joint Steering Committee (JSC): The JSC is co-chaired by the RC a nd the most senior 

representative of the central Government counterpart for the UN system . Its membership include s

key partners identified in the Cooperation Framework for joint contributions to national priorities and 

the 2030 Agenda. The JSC ensures strategic direction and oversight of the Cooperation Framework ;

alignment with national, region al and international development processes, mechanisms and goals ;

and links with other processes such as the Voluntary National Reviews . The JSC monitors progress ,

challenges and opportunities , and steer s the direction of implementation; reviews the One UN 

Country Results Report ; and supports resource mobilization for the Cooperation Framework as well 

as development financing opportunities. 

112. A JSC review takes place at least once a year . The RC presents the One UN Country Results Report, 

evaluation reports , and evaluation management responses and action plan . This is an opportunity to 

amend the Cooperation Framework to ensure continued relevance in the face of evolving national 

circumstances. The se may include humanitarian, economic , political or other unexpected situations 

of a magnitude that demands modified or immediate responses by the UN development system and 

its partners, reallocation of human and financial resources, and other measures . During the review, 

the JSC co -chairs wi ll determine if a formal revision of the Cooperation Framework is required or 

changes can be documented in the annual review report and reflected in the next joint workplan . UN 

INFO must be updated to reflect the am endments .

113. The UN development system and/or the JSC may decide to have advisory committees to support 

their work, such as a civil society committee, youth committee or private sector committee. Page 33 of 58

purpose and living nature of new generation CCAs; the methods and time employed to prepare the 

CCA, including the extent of stakeholders’ engagement;, the UN’s indepe ndent conclusion on the 

status of 2030 Agenda/SDGs in the country and Guiding Principles – Leave -no -one -behind, human 

rights -based approach, gender equality and women’s empowerment; resilience, sustainability and 

accountability; and the emerging top priori ties for advancing progress during the Decade of Action, 

focussing on the priorities of the next Cooperation Framework period. 

2. Introduction 

Content :

In drafting this section please do the following:  

> •

Briefly state what the new generation CCA is and its purpose  

> •

Describe methodology for data collection, analysis, interpretation and report 

preparation. Highlight any innovations applied in this process. (Including info on the role of 

consultants, if any were used).  

> •

Outline the collective engagemen t of UN system in the country (irrespective of 

physical location) and across the development, human rights, humanitarian and peace 

pillars.  

> •

Outline key stakeholders consulted, including government, development partners, 

International Financial Institutions, civil society, including marginalised groups, private 

sector, academia, etc.  

> •

Describe possible changes to and lessons learned from the CC A process this time 

round. 

3. Progress towards 2030 Agenda and SDGs in the Country, including Commitments 

towards International Norms and Standards 40 

Content: The below sub -headings are elements that the CCA needs to cover. The structure and 

sequence of t hese sections can naturally be adjusted based on the methodology chosen, the 

country development context etc. This is intended as guidance. Throughout these elements 

however, and in line with the guiding principles of the CCA and Cooperation Framework, the RC and 

UNCT do need to meet the following minimal requirements viz: 

(a) Building on UN assessment of regional progress, analyse progress towards, challenges and 

opportunities for national 2030 Agenda/SDG achievement, national priorities and plans, as well 

as commitments towards international norms and standards, including by undertaking root cause 

analysis of each development challenge. 

(b) Make use of analysis, evidence and data from a variety of sources, national (including State 

or public reports, academic, think tank, and civil society), regional as well as internat ional 

(including reports from UN and multilateral organizations, IFIs, development partners, academic 

and so on ). Disaggregated data should be drawn upon whenever possible. Gaps in data and data -

capacity gaps should also be assessed. 

(c) Identify hum an rights standards relevant to development challenges, map relevant 

international obligations and commitments made by the country in terms of human rights, LNOB, 

gender and the environment and connect recommendations from human rights mechanisms with 

the analysis on challenges and opportunities for SDG achievement. 

(d) Include integrated (causal) analysis within and across issues and subheadings to reflect the 

integrated nature of the SDGs; and identify underlying causes of development challenges and 

no n-fulfilment of rights 

(e) Offer forward -looking analysis that – based on development trends, including previous CCAs, 

risks and so forth – develops scenarios and outlines their implications for the country’s trajectory 

to 2030; 

(f) Identify cross b order/regional progress, challenges, opportunities and threats (NB: This would 

include consultation with UNCTs in the neighbouring countries about their analysis of common 

regional issues). 

(g) Consider institutional capacity gaps and challenges.  

> •

Ove rview of population groups (at risk of being) left behind and main drivers of 

exclusion 

Content : This section provides an overview of populations and population subgroups, who is 

(already or at risk of being) left behind and why, i.e.  multiple forms of exclusion and their 

intersection, drivers, manifestations, patterns and consequences for achieving 2030 Agenda 

noting the intersectionality across sub -groups. It could look at e.g., (1) discrimination, (2) 

governance, (3) socio -economic status, (4) geography (5) vulnerability and shocks; analyze 

what causes people to be let behind and conduct root cause , role patterns and capacity gap 

analysis in line with the HRBA methodology  

> •

Social development and exclusion analysis 

Content : For example, analyze trends in investment and outcomes for human development 

(e.g. education, health etc), leaving -no -one -behind, gender equality and women’s 41 

empowerment, resilience, accountability, and the underlying social structure of the society 

and its implications for more equitable development. In undertaking this analysis, it is 

particularly important to identify those left behind in each country context, but also those left 

furthest behind, including by analyzing these groups situation based on disaggregated data  

> •

Economic transformation analysis 

Content : For example, Including references to country profiles prepared by the UN Regional 

Economic Commissions, analyze the extent to which economic transformation is advanced 

to simultaneously maximize sustainable social, environmental and economic outcomes and 

build a new social contract; the status of economic and other inequalities and potential of 

distribution of income and wealth, public services; the extent to which budgets and economic 

and fiscal policies support greater social spending on services; digita l/ICT transformation, 

adequacy and quality of employment for an inclusive, resilient and green economy. A people -

centered approach will investigate how economic transformation is impacting vulnerable 

groups and risks of exclusion. Refer to data and evidenc e from sources outlined in the 

economic transformation companion piece.  

> •

Environment and climate change analysis and progress on global commitments 

Content : For example, progress, challenges and opportunities of environmental and climate 

change issues, including global commitments, and their linkages to economic growth and 

social inclusion; the economic and social ‘value’ of the environment; trends around natural 

resource management, energy mix, climate adaptation and disaster risk management, blue 

econ omy, protection of ecosystems, amongst others. This should include an analysis of how 

environmental problems impact on people, including particularly impacted groups, as well as 

a root cause analysis of environmental problems, with related role patterns an d capacity gaps 

analysis.

Prevention and humanitarian -development -peace linkages 

Content : For example, conduct a conflict analysis and identify drivers of fragility that can p ut 

stability and the achievement of the SDGs at risk and will require anticipatory action; in 

countries where there is a Humanitarian Response Plan and/ or a Comprehensive Refugee 

Response Framework and/ or an Integrated Strategic Framework analyse the pro gress and 

challenges in the interface and linkages between the humanitarian, human rights, 

development and peace contexts.. Such analysis is important for subsequently designing 

results shared results for the different instruments.

regional and global frameworks/goals, when relevant 42 

Content : For example, examine the national vision and national development plan, the extent 

to which they reflect the 2030 Agenda/SDGs and other re gional/global frameworks vis -à-vis 

the overall progress towards SDGs. Highlight national progress around developing and 

integration of national SDG indicators as well as institutional mechanism and systems for

Stakeholder/ Partnership Analysis 

Content : For example, map key stakeholders in the country and their contributions or lack of 

engagement with the 2030 Agenda/SDGs in the country. This can also include the cross -

cooperation with the country. Consider integrating the risk analysis into previous elements of 

Section 3. 

4. Conclusions 

Content : This section outlines the UN’s independent views on the 5 -10 key development challenges 

and opportunities that will have the most catalytic impact to achieve the SDGs. 

This section is NOT a recommendation section what the UN should focus on in the Cooperation 

Framework (this will be part of the prioritization exercise in the Cooperation Framework design 

process). Instead, this section highlights broadly the top priority issues which government and all 

other stakeholders, including the UN, ought to address to advance 2030 Agenda/SDGs, and hence 

becomes the basis for broader policy dialogues with government and other key stakeholders. 

In the next step of strategic prioritisation, which happens after the CCA, the UN will identify those 

development issues for which it has the mandate and capacity to address, amongst other criteria.

# ANNEX 4: Guidance on the Legal Annex to the Cooperation Framework 

UNSDG P rincipals endorsed in May 2022 

1.0 Background 

The 2016 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review of operational activities for development 

of the United Nations system of 21 December 2016 (“ 2016 QCPR ”) requested the “United 

Nations country teams under the leadership of the resident coordinators to strengt hen the use of 

the United Nations Development Assistance Framework , or equivalent planning framework as a 

strategic instrument ” (paragraph 50(a), United Nations General Assembly resolution 

A/RES/71/243) . General Assembly resolution 72/279 on the repositioning of the United Nations 

development system in the context of the 2016 QCPR elevated the United Nations Development 

Assistance Framework, now renamed the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation 

Framework ( “UNS DCF ” or “Cooperation Fram ework” ), to “the most important instrument for the 

planning and implementation of United Nations development activities in each country … to be 

prepared and finalized in consultation and agreement with national Governments ” (paragraph 1, 

A/RES/72/279) . The 2020 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review of 21 December 2020 

underscore d “the importance for all United Nations development system entities to prepare and 

finalize their entity -specific country development programme documents in accordance with the 

agreed priorities of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework and in 

consultation and agreement with host Governments …” (paragraph 74, United Nations General 

Assembly resolution A/RES/7 5/2 33). 

• The Cooperation Framework Legal Annex (the “Legal Annex”) is an integral part of the 

Cooperation Framework document concluded between the United Nations including its 

Funds, Programmes and other subsidiary organs, and other organizations of the United 

Nations system (“ UN System Organizations ”) , and the Government. The Legal Annex 

references the principal cooperation , assistance , or other agreements already signed 

between the UN System Organizations and the Government (the “UN Agreements”) 

which , together with the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United 

Nations of 13 February 1946 (the “General Convention”) and /or the Convention on the 

Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies of 21 November 1947 (the 

“Specialized Agencies Convention”) as applicable , form the primary existing legal basis 

for the relationship between the Government and each UN System O rganization for 

supporting the country to deliver on the Cooperation Framework . The legal instruments 

and UN Agreements referenced in the Legal Annex are non -exhaustive and without 

prejudice to any other legal instruments the Government may enter into, including 

additional agreements with UN System Organizations , for the purpose of their activities 

in the country .

2.0 Instructions on how to complete the Cooperation Framework Legal Annex. 

• No new clauses will be introduced that have not been part of a UN A greement, the 

General Convention or the Specialized Agencies Convention, as this may be questioned 48 

by Governments, leading to delay or failure to sign the Cooperation Framework 

document. However, the text of the Legal Annex in Section 3.0, paragraph 4(i) below, 

provides that a Government undertakes to apply the respective provisions of the General 

Conventi on and/or Specialized Agencies Convention , including its relevant Annexes, to 

UN System Organizations. 

• In reviewing the Legal Annex in Section 3.0 below , UN System Organizations are required 

to consult with the Legal Offices of their respective headquarters. The Legal Annex 

includes references to the UN A greements for ten UN System Organizations and makes 

provision for the insertion of the UN Agreements of additional UN System Organizations 

that are not already listed. In particular, UN System O rganizations , including those that 

are not currently reflected in the Legal Annex , should seek advice directly from the ir 

Legal Offices on the references to their respective UN Agreements listed in the Legal 

Annex , as well as the specific text for additional UN Agreements to be included. This 

consultation should be undertaken at the beginning of the Cooperation Framework 

preparation process and , in any event, prior to the subm ission of the Legal Annex text in 

any form to the Government , rather than in the finalization stage , to prevent delay in 

finalization and signature of the Cooperation Framework document. 

• The Legal Annex in Section 3.0 below should be extracted from this guidance ,

completed as appropriate in accord ance with the advice received from the UN System 

Organization’s Legal Office , adopted verbatim (with respect to the text already set out in 

Section 3 .0 ) and annexed to the first draft Cooperation Framework document presented 

for discussion with the Government. This will allow queries from the Government to be 

answered at an early stage of the Cooperation Framework finalization process. 

• The Legal Annex must r emain an integral part of all the evolving drafts of the 

Cooperation Framework document, including the final draft presented for signature by 

the Government and UN System Organizations .

3.0 The Cooperation Framework Legal Annex text 

As noted above, the Legal Annex references the principal UN A greements which , together with 

the General Convention and /or the Specialized Agencies Convention as applicable , form the 

primary existing legal basis for the relationship between the Government and each UN System 

Organization for supporting the country to deliver on the Cooperation Framework (20 —to 2 0—).

# ANNEX 5: Instructions for Integrating Programme and Risk Management 

# Clauses into the Cooperation Framework 

UNSDG P rincipals endorsed in May 2022 

Instructions: The Programme Management and Accountability supplement consists of important 

clauses related to the modality for programme execution, Harmonized Cash Transfers (HACT), 

resource mobilization, and monitoring and evaluation as part of implementing the Cooperation 

Framework. For overall coherence of the Cooperation Framework narrative , simply treat this as a 

separate ann ex (Annex 5) to the Cooperation Framework. Therefore, national Government 

signature on the Cooperation Framework document signifies commitment to these programme 

management and risk management clauses .

Annex 5: Programme Management & Accountability in the Cooperation Framework 

1. Introduction 

The programme will be nationally executed under the overall co -ordination of _______ 

(Government Co -ordinating Authority). Government coordinating authorities for specific UN 

system agency programmes are noted in Annex ---. Government Ministries, NGOs, ING Os and 

UN system agencies will implement programme activities. The Cooperation Framework will be 

made operational through the development of joint work plan(s) (JWPs) 51 and/or agency -

specific work plans and project documents as necessary which describe the specific results to 

be achieved and will form an agreement between the UN system agencies and each 

implementing partner as necessary on the use of resources. To the ex tent possible the UN 

system agencies and partners will use the minimum documents necessary, namely the signed 

Cooperation Framework and signed joint or agency -specific work plans and project documents 

to implement programmatic initiatives. However, as nece ssary and appropriate, project 

documents can be prepared using, inter alia, the relevant text from the Cooperation Framework 

and joint or agency -specific work plans and / or project documents 52 .

Cash assistance for travel, stipends, honoraria and other costs shall be set at rates 

commensurate with those applied in the country, but not higher than those applicable to the 

United Nations system (as stated in the ICSC circulars). 

2. Programme Implementation ( Mandatory HACT text )

All cash transfers to an Implementing Partner are based on the Work Plans (WPs 53 ) agreed 

between the Implementing Partner and the UN system agencies. 

Cash transfers for activities detailed in work plans (WPs) can be made by the UN system 

agencies using the following modalities: 

1. Cash transferred directly to the Implementing Partner: 

a. Prior to the start of activities (direct cash transfer), or 

b. After activities have been completed (reimbursement); 

2. Direct payment to vendors or third parties for obligations incurred by the Implementing 

Partners on the basis of requests signed by the designated official of the Implementing 

Partner; 

3. Direct payments to vendors or third parties for obligations incurred by UN system agencies 

in support of activities agreed with Implementing Partners. 

[In countries where it has been agreed that cash will be transferred to institutions other than 

the Implementing Partner (e.g., the Treasury) please replace with the following text:] 

Cash transfers for activities detailed in work plans (WPs) can be made by the UN system 

agencies using the following modalities: 

1. Cash transferred to the [national institution] for forwarding to the Implementing Partner: 

a. Prior to the start of activities (direct cash transfer ), or
